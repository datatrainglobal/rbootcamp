# Making some maps

Maps are great for exploring geographic data, like the prevalences of diseases in different countries or the
demographics of voting districts in different states. In addition to being efficient data visualizations, 
well made maps can be beautiful to look at!

1. Open a new R script and name it `maps.R`

2. Write code to load the following libraries: `dplyr`, `sf`, `spData`, `tmap`, and `tidycensus`

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(spData)
library(tmap)
library(tidycensus)
```

3. Add the following code to your script and run it to make your first map:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
tm_shape( us_states ) + tm_polygons( )
```
