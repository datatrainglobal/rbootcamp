# Dataframes

#### Learning goals {-}

* Understand what a dataframe is and how to effectively explore it
* Understand the concept of "tidy" data

&nbsp;  

As a data scientist, the most common data structure you will be working with -- by far -- is a **dataframe**. But before working with dataframes, we need to understand what they are and how they should be structured. The below is largely borrowed from Hadley Wickham's excellent tutorial on "tidy data" [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) and the vignette on tidy data [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html).


## Data tidying

It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the cleaning and preparing data. And it’s not just a first step, but it must be repeated many times over the course of analysis as new problems come to light or new data is collected. To get a handle on the problem, this paper focuses on a small, but important, aspect of data cleaning that I call data tidying: structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.

The principles of tidy data provide a standard way to organise data values within a dataset. A standard makes initial data cleaning easier because you don’t need to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel every time. The tidy data standard has been designed to facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data, and to simplify the development of data analysis tools that work well together. Current tools often require translation. You have to spend time munging the output from one tool so you can input it into another. Tidy datasets and tidy tools work hand in hand to make data analysis easier, allowing you to focus on the interesting domain problem, not on the uninteresting logistics of data.

## Data semantics

A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes.

## Tidy data

Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data:

1. Every column is a variable.

2. Every row is an observation.

3. Every cell is a single value.


## Messy data

Column headers are values, not variable names.

Multiple variables are stored in one column.

Variables are stored in both rows and columns.

Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.

A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

## Examples 

You can represent the same underlying data in multiple ways.
The example below shows the same data organised in four different ways.
Each dataset shows the same values of four variables: *country*, *year*, *population*, and *cases* of TB (tuberculosis), but each dataset organizes the values in a different way.

<!-- TODO redraw as tables -->

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
table1
table2
table3

# Spread across two tibbles
table4a # cases
table4b # population
```

These are all representations of the same underlying data, but they are not equally easy to use.
One of them, `table1`, will be much easier to work with inside the tidyverse because it's tidy.

There are three interrelated rules that make a dataset tidy:

1.  Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.
2.  Each observation is row; each row is an observation.
3.  Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.
