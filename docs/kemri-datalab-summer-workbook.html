<p>This summer you all are going to work as a team and learn to code and also get to know one another. So what is a better way to get to know someone than by learning about their hometown? Today, in your groups you are going to put dots on a map that represent every person’s hometown from your group.</p>
<p>Follow this document together as a team to make this map:</p>
<div id="make-your-dataset" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Make your dataset<a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#make-your-dataset" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Make one Google sheet and title it: <code>team_lat_lng</code> with columns <code>first_name</code>, <code>organization</code>, <code>LAT</code>, and <code>LNG</code>. <em>Note: make sure these columns are in this exact order, spelled exactly like this, with <code>LAT</code> and <code>LNG</code> in all caps!</em></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Click ‘Share’ in the top right of the google sheet and in ‘General access’ click ‘Anyone with the link’. <em>Note: this is important because in order to read data into R, it must be available to be accessed by everyone.</em></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Input everyone’s name, organization (either DataLab or KEMRI), hometown latitude and longitude in the associated columns. To find your latitude and longitude, go to Google Maps, right click your hometown, then input the latitude (the first number) and longitude (the second number) from Google Maps into your Google sheet. As an example, we can tell from the following that Sewanee’s latitude is 35.20318 and Sewanee’s longitude is -85.92203 :</p>
</center>
<img src="img/sewanee_lat_lng.png"/>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong><em>Watch out!</em></strong> <strong>Just enter numbers for latitudes and longitudes, don’t include any letters indicating north, south, east, or west</strong>. Sewanee’s longitude is negative, since Sewanee is west of the prime meridian; Sewanee’s latitude is positive, since Sewanee is north of the equator.</p>
<p>All done? Woohoo! You have your dataset!</p>
</div>
<div id="load-in-your-data" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Load in your data<a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#load-in-your-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>4.</strong> For the KEMRI team, make a folder called <code>name_datalab</code> on your desktop (make sure to put your name where I wrote name). Everyone, in your <code>name_datalab</code> folder make another folder called <code>team_map</code>.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Everyone open up <code>RStudio</code>, make an <code>RScript</code> called <code>our_map.R</code>, and save it into your <code>team_map</code> folder.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Starting now, make sure you comment every line of your script. So make a comment that says <code># set working directory</code> and set your working directory to your <code>team_map</code> folder.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Load the following libraries (if you don’t have them make sure to install them with <code>install.packages()</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb128"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb128-1"><a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#cb128-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(sf)</span>

<span id="cb128-4"><a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#cb128-4" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(gsheet)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Now, there are two ways to load in your data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Download the Google sheet as a csv file and and save it into your <code>team_map</code> folder. Then in your RScript load in the data and assign it to an object:</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb129"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb129-1"><a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#cb129-1" tabindex="-1"></a>locations <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">&#39;team_lat_lng.csv&#39;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In your environment do you have <code>locations</code>? If so, great!</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Another simpler way to download the data is by using the following:</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb130"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb130-1"><a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#cb130-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># be sure to put the correct link inside the quotes below!</span></span>

<p>Still have <code>locations</code> after this? Wonderful!</p>
</div>
<div id="make-your-map" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Make your map<a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#make-your-map" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Now that you have your <code>locations</code> object, we have to tell R what to do with it. First, format things correctly:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb131"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb131-1"><a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#cb131-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># convert latitude and longitude into a geometry column:</span></span>
<span id="cb131-2"><a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#cb131-2" tabindex="-1"></a>locations <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">st_as_sf</span>( locations, <span class="at">coords =</span> <span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;LNG&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;LAT&quot;</span>), <span class="at">crs =</span> <span class="st">&quot;WGS84&quot;</span> )</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Now look at your <code>locations</code> object – you should see that you have <code>POINT</code>s in the <code>geometry</code> column. Since we have points instead of polygons, we need to use <code>tmap</code>’s <code>tm_dots</code> function instead of the <code>tm_polygons</code> function we’ve used to make our other maps. Here’s the code to make an interactive map with color-coded points:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb132"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb132-1"><a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#cb132-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">tmap_mode</span>( <span class="st">&quot;view&quot;</span> )</span>

<h3>The request from the client<a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#the-request-from-the-client" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear team,
Today, we received some data from a PhD student from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She has been collecting data over the past 2 years on a small subset of kids submitted to neonatology. Her supervisor has requested you to look at some of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>outcome of delivery (baby is okay and if baby was admitted to nenotolagy)</li>
<li>malaria during pregnancy</li>
<li>weight, height and apgar</li>
<li>completeness of variables</li>
<li>numbers of variables</li>
<li>the mean age of women</li>
<li>number of kids submitted to icu/neonatology</li>
<li>who went to clinic and who did not go to clinic</li>
<li>how many had a single or double or triple delivery</li>
<li>mean birth weight and height and range &amp; mean apgar and range</li>
<li>difference time of when delivery was made (day vs. night)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the client has requested a neonatology descriptive paper. Please send me an update once a week so that I can see how you are progressing, but I am excited to see the final product in 4 weeks time.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Your super cool and suave boss</p>

<h3>Understanding the request and the data dictionary<a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#understanding-the-request-and-the-data-dictionary" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The first thing I do before diving into programming is look over the request and the data dictionary. Reading and understanding the request gives us an idea of what variables will be most important to us when reading the data dictionary. It is also important to define words and/or acronyms that you aren’t familiar with. <strong>It is vital to understand the data before using it, otherwise you might get unexpected results or unintentionally misuse or misrepresent the data.</strong></p>
<p>The data dictionary can be found <a href="https://mbrudd.com/drc_data/DICCIONARIO%20DE%20BASE%20DE%20DATOS%20PALUDISMO%20Y%20MUJER%20EMBARAZADA.pdf">here</a>. Unfortunately, it is in another language that I can not speak or read. Fortunately, <a href="https://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a> allows you to upload a PDF to translate in full. Here is the result of Google’s translation:</p>
<embed src="docs/figures/translated-DRC-Neonatology-Data-Dictionary.pdf" width="100%" height="750" type="application/pdf" />
<p><br>
It is important to note that not all translations are accurate. If something is unclear or doesn’t make sense, investigate it. <strong>Once again, it is vital to understand the data before using it, otherwise you might get unexpected results or unintentionally misuse or misrepresent the data.</strong></p>
<p>Here is a list of words/acronyms I was unfamiliar with and their definitions according to Google:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neonatology - “the branch of medicine concerned with the treatment and care of newborn babies”</li>
<li>Eutocic - “a normal birth, which happens without complications from the beginning to the end”</li>
<li>APGAR - “The Apgar score is a quick way for health professionals to evaluate the health of all newborns at 1 and 5 minutes after birth and in response to resuscitation.”</li>
<li>ANC - “Antenatal care (ANC) coverage is an indicator of access and use of health care during pregnancy.”</li>
<li>IPTp - “Intermittent preventive therapy or intermittent preventive treatment is a public health intervention aimed at treating and preventing malaria episodes in infants, children, schoolchildren and pregnant women.”</li>
<li>Hematocrit - “the ratio of the volume of red blood cells to the total volume of blood”</li>
<li>Neonate - “a newborn child”</li>
<li>Neutrophils - “Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell (leukocytes) that act as your immune system’s first line of defense.”</li>
<li>Leukocytes - “a type of blood cell that is made in the bone marrow and found in the blood and lymph tissue”</li>
<li>Eosinophils - “Eosinophils, sometimes called eosinophiles or, less commonly, acidophils, are a variety of white blood cells and one of the immune system components responsible for combating multicellular parasites and certain infections in vertebrates.”</li>
</ul>
<p>One important question I have is “What are the expected values of the APGAR score?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are 5 parts to an Apgar score. Each category is weighted evenly and assigned a 0, 1, or 2 value. The components are then added to give a score recorded 1 and 5 minutes after birth. A score of 7 to 10 is considered reassuring, a score of 4 to 6 is moderately abnormal, and a score of 0 to 3 is deemed low in full-term and late preterm infants, at 5 minutes, when an infant has a score of &lt;7, Neonatal Resuscitation Program guidelines recommend continued recording at 5-minute intervals up to 20 minutes. Scoring during resuscitation is not equivalent to an infant not undergoing resuscitation because resuscitative efforts alter several score elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given this information, we should expect the APGAR scores to fall withing 0 and 10, which matches the data dictionary. If any scores are outside of that range, it is clearly an error.</p>

<p>Wow, that’s a lot of columns!</p>
<p>Do note that a lot, if not all, of the ‘anc_vx_…’ columns, where x is a number, are detailed in the data dictionary in the variables that have ‘V1’ in the name. The highest value of x that I’ve seen is 11, meaning that for each of those variables, there may be up to 11 columns representing different visits. Let’s check to make sure.</p>
<p>We should expect 11 instances of these 27 columns corresponding to each potential visit, which is a total of 297 columns. The code below checks if the expected ‘anc_v1_…’ through ‘anc_v11_…’ columns are in the data frame and prints out the ones that are missing.</p>

<p>It appears that we are missing the above 16 “anc_vx” columns.</p>
<p>Let’s continue to look through the remaining columns to make sure that they are in the data dictionary and make sense.</p>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;...1&quot;            &quot;country&quot;         &quot;indicator_name&quot; 
[4] &quot;ISO3&quot;            &quot;region_name&quot;     &quot;unit_of_measure&quot;
[7] &quot;value&quot;           &quot;year&quot;           </code></pre>
<p>These all look good to me! As far as I can tell, the only columns missing that are in the data dictionary are mother’s first name, mother’s last name, mother’s phone number 1, mother’s phone number 2, baby 1’s first name, baby 1’s last name, baby 2’s first name, and baby 2’s last name. These columns have been intentionally removed from the data beforehand to keep the data as anonymous as possible while still being useful.</p>

<p>Notice that I’ve made a separate data frame for cleaning. This makes it easier to rerun code without having to completely reload the data from the source. It also makes it easy to compare the original data with the modified data.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Never remove or modify the original data from the source, even if it is obviously incorrect! Always work on a copy of the data!</strong> If you modify the original data and your changes end up being incorrect, then you’ve tampered with the data and potentially ruined the entire data set. Another advantage of working on a copy of the data and cleaning it with code is that it documents everything we do, making what we’ve done clear and reproducible. Fortunately in this case, our source data isn’t something we can modify directly; however, there are cases in which you might be given the source data in an unprotected way that would allow you to overwrite it. An example of this would be using the <code>googlesheets4</code> library, which allows you to read and write directly to a Google sheet. This can dangerous if you aren’t careful!</p>

<p>According to the data dictionary, acceptable values are ‘M’ for married, ‘C’ for single, and ‘non reporté’ for not reported. I’ll also treat NA values as if they were ‘non reporté’ since both mean that the value is missing for that row.</p>

<p>There are values of ‘D’ for marital_status, which is not in the data dictionary. It might mean divorced; however, it’s best to talk to the client before assuming anything. It could also be an error inputting the value ‘C’, since the two letters look similar. For now, I’ll keep those values in the data. To remove them though, I’d use the code below. Once again, I’ve set the chunk’s <code>eval</code> flag to <code>FALSE</code> to prevent it from running. To run it, change the flag back to <code>eval = TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>Also, notice that I’ve used the <code>tolower()</code> function. The values in the column may be capitalized in inconsistent ways. Forcing them all to be lowercase in the filter function allows us to ignore the inconsistent capitalization without changing the actual data to all lowercase. You can permanently change the data to lowercase using the <code>mutate()</code> function; however, in some scenarios, the capitalization might be important, especially when it comes to acronyms and abbreviations.</p>

<p>The data dictionary doesn’t define all of the possible values for this column, so I’ve decided to explore all of the unique values in our data. It would be a great idea to look at these closer on an individual level to understand what each value means and whether or not it is appropriate for this column.</p>
<p>We can also see that some of the values appear to be the same but are written in different ways.</p>

<p>The time of delivery values vary in format. It may be best to remove delivery times not in the format of ‘HH:MM’, ‘H:MM’, NA, or ‘non reporté’. The following code does so, but I’ve set the <code>eval</code> flag to <code>FALSE</code> to prevent it from running.</p>

<p>The data dictionary defines these columns as the baby’s weight in grams at birth, so let’s check for values that aren’t numeric, NA, or ‘non reporté’.</p>

<p>There are two instances of the second baby’s weight being ‘M’. That doesn’t make sense!</p>
<p>Here’s how to keep only the numeric, NA, or ‘non reporté’ values and filter out the rest. Once again, I’ve set the chunk’s <code>eval</code> flag to <code>FALSE</code> to prevent it from running. To run it, change the flag back to <code>eval = TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>Another thing to ask is, “Do the reported weights actually make sense?” Remember, the units should be in grams!</p>

<p><strong>This is NOT a comprehensive cleaning script for this data. There is a lot more work to be done; however, this is a good starting point.</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to show you my thought process and the techniques I use to clean data. As you use the data, you will inevitably find more issues and realize that there’s more cleaning to be done. Sometimes it isn’t obvious that there is a mistake in the data even after you’ve generated visualizations and run tests on it, so it is vital to do your due diligence and get to know your data BEFORE using it.</p>
<p>This process can be disheartening, but remember, the work we are doing matters and it is worth every second to go back and add to or modify our cleaning scripts. Not only is it the responsible and moral thing to do, it’s also what we are paid to do!</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough the importance of looking deeper into the data to find out what we are working with and why we get the results that we get. The accuracy and reliability of our findings, as well as the reputation of ourselves, our organization, and any other affiliations are on the line!</p>

<p>As a team work together to answer the following questions to make a mini-report on the DRC dataset:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open up an RMarkdown file and save it in your name_datalab folder and call it <code>descriptive_DRC_analysis.Rmd</code> and title the document <code>Neonatal mortality in DRC Congo</code>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Click knit. What do you see? As a team discuss what you want to delete and keep and make sure everyone knows what an RMarkdown file is before moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Make another section called <code>Introduction</code> (hint: use one hashtag to make a title). In the introduction include the following information and replace the <code>_</code> with information you find in the appropriate links:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Globally _ million children died in the first 20 days of life in 2022. There are
approximately _ newborn deaths every day, amounting to _% of all child deaths
under the age of 5 years (WHO, 2024)[<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/newborn-mortality" class="uri">https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/newborn-mortality</a>].</p>
<p>Up to _ of newborn deaths can be prevented if known and if effective health measures
are provided at birth and during the first week of life. The vast majority of newborn deaths take place in developing countries where access to health care is low. Most of these newborns die at home, without skilled care that could greatly increase their chances for survival (WHO)[<a href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/newborn" class="uri">https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/newborn</a>].</p>
<p>Malaria is common during pregnancy and can have serious consequences for neonatal health. Neonatal morbidity and mortality can be significantly reduced by proper
implementation of insecticide-treated nets and intermittent preventive treatment (source)[<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21118620/" class="uri">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21118620/</a>].</p>
<p>The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2022, the Region was home to 94% of malaria cases (233 million) and 95% (580,000) of malaria deaths. DRC Congo accounted for 12% of all malaria in the world in 2022.</p>
<p>DRC is one of the poorest countries in the world (source)[<a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/congo-democratic-republic-of-the/" class="uri">https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/congo-democratic-republic-of-the/</a>]. The health care system in DRC is highly dependent of private actors. Care-seeking and treatment for malaria in the private sector (including non-profit and faith-based facilities, for-profit clinics, pharmacies, and drug shops) is widespread. According to the 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey
(DHS), among children with fever, _ percent report seeking care in the public sector and _ percent in the private sector (source)[<a href="https://www.severemalaria.org/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/drc-health-system" class="uri">https://www.severemalaria.org/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/drc-health-system</a>].</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Make another section called <code>Aims/Objective</code> and insert the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will work together to generate hypothesis around delivery outcomes and interrogate this dataset in search for answers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Make a section called <code>Preliminary Research</code> and under this section title create a code chunk.</p>

     ^</code></pre>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Paste the following inside your code chunk to load your libraries and load your data:</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: the code above will not get you the answer, you will have to edit it.</strong></p>
<p>Good work! You made a lot of progress today. We will pick up next week to keep working on your report.</p>
</div>
<div id="day-4-july-2nd" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Day 4: July 2nd<a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#day-4-july-2nd" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Last week you began working on descriptives of the DRC data. This week you will continue on the descriptives for the DRC data in order to make a report. First, let’s finish the descriptives.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open up your RMarkdown file from last week. The client has shared even more data with us so we need to load in the most up to date data. Run the following line of code where you originally load in the data:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb145"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb145-1"><a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#cb145-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># download data</span></span>
<span id="cb145-2"><a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#cb145-2" tabindex="-1"></a>df <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">&#39;https://mbrudd.com/drc_data/DRC_data_v3.csv&#39;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Re-run your code from last week. Does it work? If not, edit the sections of code that you need to in order to make your RMarkdown work and is correct.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Now that your RScript works your goal is to finish the descriptive tables for the DRC data. Finish questions 1 through 15 from last week.</p>
<p>Finished the questions from last week? Great! Time to move onto the final descriptive pieces. Some of the following questions you may have done last week so move forward until you are at a question that you have not completed yet.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> How many women had malaria during pregnancy? To do this let’s find the variable. Look at the <a href="https://datatrain.cc/kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#understanding-the-request-and-the-data-dictionary">code book</a> pasted above. Does the variable malaria_diagnosis look like the right variable? How does the variable look? Is it clean or do we need to edit some of the responses in order to calculate how many women had malaria during pregnancy? Be sure to add this number to your report as a sentence.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> On average of the women who have had malaria during pregnancy how many times have they had malaria? <em>Hint: number_malaria_diagnosis is the variable to use and you can follow the instructions from the question above.</em></p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Of the babies born, how many males and females are there? <em>Hint: baby_1_sex, baby_2_sex</em></p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Find mean birth weight and height and the range of all babies. For this try creating an object called baby_1 that only has the columns that you need and another object called baby_2 with the columns that you need. How do the responses inside those columns look? Do they need to be edited? Once the columns look good, rename the columns of each dataset so that they match and then use the following code to merge the objects together and perform the calculations from there. <em>Hint: weight_at_birth_baby_1, weight_at_birth_baby_2</em></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb146"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb146-1"><a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#cb146-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># merge the datasets that you make in order to find mean birth weight and height and range</span></span>
<span id="cb146-2"><a href="kemri-datalab-summer-workbook.html#cb146-2" tabindex="-1"></a>baby_1_2 <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">bind_rows</span>(baby_1, baby_2)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Find mean apgar and range. To do this add the necessary columns to your <code>baby_1_2</code> datasets (<code>apgar_1_baby_1</code>, <code>apgar_5_baby_1</code>, <code>apgar_10_baby_1</code>, <code>apgar_1_baby_2</code>, <code>apgar_5_baby_2</code>, <code>apgar_10_baby_2</code>) then calculate. Do these answers make sense according to general APGAR scores? Google what a normal APGAR score is. Make a note of how many abnormal APGAR scores are are in each column. Then create a new dataset called <code>apgar_df</code> and filter out any abnormal APGAR scores and re-calculate the mean apgar and range.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> How many people were born in the day and the night? Again, for this question add the necessary columns to the <code>data_1_2</code> dataset (<code>time_of_delivery_baby_1</code>, <code>time_of_delivery_baby_2</code>). Be sure to make this column into a date time type and then make a new column called <code>day_or_night</code>. From there determine how many babies were born in the day and in the night. Add this information to your report.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> How many single and double deliveries were there? Talk as a team and come up with a way to determine this. Maybe think about how there are columns specifically for baby_1 and for baby_2…</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> In relation to the question above, is there a baby_3? Does that mean there could be a triple delivery? If so, tell me how many triple deliveries there were.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> Make a table of all the outcomes of delivery. Don’t edit the information in the data. Make this table print in your report. <em>Hint: baby_1_outcome, etc.</em></p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> Knit your report. Do you have any errors? If so, fix’em. If not, how does your report read? Does it make sense? Edit the report so that if you gave it to your client today, they would understand what you did and why you did it.</p>
<p><strong>14</strong>. How does your code look? Could someone who had never seen your RScript before be able to understand what you are doing and why? Go back and comment your code and make sure your code is reproducible!</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> Good work today! Next week you will do some exploration on your own, but these descriptives serve as a good base to move forward. Have 1 person from your team send their RMarkdown in the DataLab slack. Once your done talk with your team about what you would like to look into next week and maybe ask about each other’s lives outside of coding…</p>
