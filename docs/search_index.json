[["index.html", "R Bootcamp Module 1 Welcome What is this website? Who are we?", " R Bootcamp Module 1 Welcome What is this website? This is not a textbook or an encyclopedia. This is not a reference manual. It is not exhaustive or comprehensive. We barely mention statistical tests at all. There is almost no theory. In fact, this curriculum is biased, non-representative, and incomplete – by design. So what is this? This website is a guide designed to help you through the most dangerous period in your data science education: your very first steps. The first few weeks. That is when 99% percent of people give up on learning to code. You want to be part of the 1%? Okay, then you need to understand these 3 things: Premise 1: We learn best by doing. Our goal is to get you doing data science. We will keep theory and detail to a minimum. We will give you the absolute basics, then offer you exercises and puzzles that motivate you to learn the rest. Then, once you’ve been doing data science for a bit, you soon begin thinking like a data scientist. By that, we mean tackling ambiguous problems with persistence, independence, and creative problem solving. With the focus on doing (as opposed to listening, reading, watching, etc.), the burden is on you. You gotta do the work. Premise 2: We learn best with purpose. Once you gain comfort with the basic skills, you will be able to start working on real data, for real projects, with real impact. You will start to care about what you are coding. And that is when the learning curve skyrockets – because you are motivated, and because you are learning reactively, instead of preemptively. Our goal is to get you to the point of take-off as quickly as possible. Premise 3: A simple toolbox is all you need to build a house. Once you become comfortable with a few basic coding tools, you can build pretty much anything. The toolbox doesn’t need to be that big; if you know how to use your tools well, and if you have enough building supplies (i.e., data), the possibilities are limitless. One more thing that this is not: This is not a fancy interactive tutorial with bells or whistles. We purposefully designed this to be simple and “analog”. You will not be typing your code into this website and getting feedback from a robot, or setting up an account to track your progress, or getting pretty merit badges or points when you complete each module. Instead, you will be doing your work on your own machine, working with real folders and files, downloading data and moving it around, etc. – all the things you will be doing as a real data scientist in the real world. Enough talk. Let’s go. Click on “Setting up your computer” and let’s get to work. Who are we? Datatrain (www.datatrain.global) is a project of Databrew (www.databrew.cc). "],["setting-up-your-computer.html", "Module 2 Setting up your computer Install R Install RStudio Install packages", " Module 2 Setting up your computer It’s time to set up your system. Ready? Let’s go. Install R First, let’s get the right programs installed on your computer. Then we will explain what they are and why you need them. First, download and install R: Go to the following website, click the Download button, and follow the website’s instructions from there. https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/ Install RStudio Second, download and install RStudio: Go to the following website and choose the free Desktop version: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Third, make sure RStudio opens successfully: Open the RStudio app. A window should appear that looks like this: Fourth, make sure R is running correctly in the background: In RStudio, in the pane on the left (the “Console”), type 2+2 and hit Enter. If R is working properly, the number “4” will be printed in the next line down. Finally, some minor adjustments to make RStudio run smoother (and look cooler): Go to Tools &gt; Global Options and make sure your General settings match these exactly: Specifically, uncheck the option under Workspace to ‘Restore .RData into workspace at startup.’ Now go to the Appearance settings and choose a cool theme! Boom! You’ve got R up and running. Now it’s time to install some packages. Install packages Packages are what makes R so great. To install a package, open Rstudio and type the following code into the “Console” in the bottom left Did that work? Probably not, because “packagename” is not a real R package. The packages we’ll be using are the following: tidyverse RColorBrewer leaflet ggthemes rmarkdown sp To install all of these, you can run install.packages for each package: So, now you’ve got R, RStudio, and some cool packages. Good job. You’re ready for the next module.

Two-minute tour of RStudio", " Module 3 First code Are you ready to write some code? I hope so, because it’s time. File paths Good organization is the key to success, so let’s start by creating a folder for all of your DataLab work. … now that you’ve done this, REMEMBER WHERE YOUR FOLDER IS AND STAY ORGANIZED!! Scripts and your workspace In RStudio, click “File” in the upper left and then “New file -&gt; R Script”. This will open a window pane in the upper left of your screen. This “script” is basically a place for you to write and save code. Got it? Good. Now click “File” then “Save as” and then save your script locally somewhere where you’ll remember it. For example, you could save it on your “Desktop” as a file named “firstcode.R”. Your workspace consists of: Your script (upper left). This is where you talk to R. The console (bottom left). This is where R talks back to you. The “environment” (upper right). This is a place where you can explore data “objects” you’ve created (don’t worry, we’ll get there). The “plots” tab (bottom right). This is where you’ll see outputs of charts, maps, etc. R as a calculator At its most basic, R is a big calculator. Or a conversation partner. However you like to think of it. You talk to R by typing some code in your script (upper left), and R talks back by printing something in the console (bottom left). For example, if you want to ask R what two plus two is, you’d write this on line one of your script. 2 + 2 Then, if you place your cursor on that line and run “ctrl + enter” (or “cmd + enter” if on Mac), that code will “run” and R will give you the response. [1] 4 Cool, huh? You can, of course, type more complex math problems. Try typing the following on line 2: 10392 * (13/72)^2 - sqrt(9.123) + (475/2.2)^3 Did you get the below as an answer? [1] 10065313 Good. As you can see, some calculations are pretty straightforward, like addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/), and even multiplication (*). 4 + 4 4 - 3 12 / 6 10 * 10 You can even perform calculations with negative numbers. 96 + -2 And exponents can be denoted like this. 2 ^2 100 ^5 Make sure you have run all of these in your computer. Done? Great, that’s R as a calculator. Re-running code Sometimes you may want to re-run a line of code that you just ran or to recall code so that you can adjust it slightly. Click anywhere in the Console and then press your keyboard’s Up arrow. That line of code that appears in your Console is the last line of code you just ran. Good work! Try clicking the Up arrow three times. Do you see the line of code that you ran three times ago? Yes you do. That’s because R keeps a history of everything you have said to it since you opened this window. So if you keep pressing your Up arrow, R will show you all of the lines of code you previously ran. If you don’t want this old command, simply press Escape to reset the Console’s command line, and now you’re ready to re-run code in the Console. Incomplete commands Similar to talking to a friend, if you start a sentence and don’t finish it, your friend will get confused. R gets confused when you enter an incomplete command and will wait for you to finish it in the Console before doing anything. For example, try running this code in your Console: 45 - Is R giving you a little + sign on the line under your command? That’s because it is waiting for you to complete your command. If you want to complete it, add a number (e.g., 3) and hit Enter. You should now be given an answer (e.g., 42). Or, if instead you want R to stop waiting and stop running, just press the Escape key Getting errors Our commands can’t only be complete, but they need to follow the rules of R. We know that if the command is incomplete that R will give us a + sign, but what about when we don’t follow the rules of R? Try running this code in your Console: 4 + y You probably received a message in red font stating: Error: object ‘y’ not found. That is because R did know how to interpret the symbol y in this case, so it just gave up. If R does not understand your code, it will throw an error and give up on trying to execute that line of code but don’t be deterred when you see an error! They happen all the time, even to the professionals. The only thing we can do is read your code, find the errors, and fix them. Here’s another piece of code that will produce an error (just for fun): dfjkltr9fitwt985ut9e3 Using parentheses Another rule of R pertains to parentheses. Exactly how it is done in math, you can use parentheses to exert control over the order in which you perform calculations. For example, these two commands produce different results: 2*7 - 2*5 / 2 (2*7 - 2*5) / 2 Note parentheses need to come in pairs: whenever you type an open parenthesis, (eventually you need to provide a corresponding closed parenthesis). A very common way to get errors is by missing a parentheses. For instance, the following line of code will return a plus sign (+) since R is waiting for you to close the parenthetical before it processes your command: 4 + (5 No matter how many parenthesis you have always close your parenthesis. Based on this which of the below is correct and why? (((5+5))) (((5+5)) So lesson is… always close your parentheses even for the funny ones like {…} and […]. Use built-in R functions R has some built-in “functions” for common calculations. Rather than defining a function let’s just do some. Let’s find the square-root of a number using the ‘squirt’ command, sqrt(): sqrt(16) Note the use of parentheses here. When you are calling a function, when you see parentheses, think of the word ‘of’. This line translates to ‘the square root of 16’. You are taking the sqrt of the number inside the parenthetical. Let’s try again with a different function. Find: the log of 4. log(4) Note that the function log() is the natural log function (i.e., the value that e must be raised to in order to equal 4). To calculate a base-10 logarithm, use log10( ). log(10) log10(10) Another handy function is round(), for rounding numbers to a specific number of decimal places. 100/3 round(100/3) round(100/3,digits=1) round(100/3,digits=2) round(100/3,digits=3) Finally, R also comes with some built-in values, such as pi: pi So now that you have used a few functions, let’s define it. A function is a package of code that does the following: takes a given value, transforms it according to some internal code instructions, and provides an output. You will learn more about functions later, but this is a good intro. Objects and vectors R can do so much more than be just a calculator. Your first step in uncovering the potential of R is to make variables. All things variables To assign numbers or other types of data to a variable, you use the &lt; and - characters to make the arrow symbol &lt;-. x &lt;- 1 y &lt;- 2 Where did those values go? You do not see the numbers printed in the Console because the values were stored in the variables x, and y. These are now in the Environment. So how do we use or see these variables? If you want R to tell you what x is, just type the variable name and run it. x If you want to do calculations with the variables then do it. x + 100 x * 2 x + y If you want to do calculations with variables and make that answer into a new variable, you can do that too. z &lt;- x + y - 1 In R, a variable is another way to refer to value. That value can be as simple as a single number (e.g., 6) or as complex as a spreadsheet with thousands of rows and columns. Think of a variable as a cup; just as cups make it easy to hold your coffee and carry it from the kitchen to the couch, variables make it easy to contain and work with data. Let’s make a new variable from x that isn’t just one value but is multiple values. a &lt;- rep(x, 5) How do you look at the response of a again? What does it look like the rep() function does? Since a isn’t just a single value, we can do some cool things, like find how many values are in the variable: length(a) Let’s create a vector, which is very similar to what we did above, and do some calculations: b &lt;- c(1,2,3) b + 100 b * 2 Good work! You’re a master of this. So let’s make it interesting. Let’s look at some various ages. To start we need to make a new vector and give it a name, however A variable/vector name has to have at least one letter in it, A variable/vector name has to be connected. AKA no spaces. Instead of a space try a period ( . ) or an underscore ( _ ). Note: hyphens cannot be used, There are some other rules, but we can learn them as we go so let’s jump in and create a variable with some ages and find out some information about these ages. ages &lt;- c(20, 30, 25, 35) mean(ages) max(ages) min(ages) median(ages) summary(ages) Now, in data it is super common to have NAs so let’s make a vector called ages but introduce an NA and re-do all those functions. Does it work? ages &lt;- c(20, 30, 25, 35, NA, 28) mean(ages) It doesn’t work! Well what if we try this: ages &lt;- c(20, 30, 25, 35, NA, 28) mean(ages, na.rm = TRUE) Did it work? Of course it did because you’re a genius! But more importantly it actually worked because the na.rm = TRUE is removing the NA. We are saying “take the mean of ages and remove the NAs.” What happens if we set na.rm to FALSE? mean(ages, na.rm = FALSE) Why didn’t this work? This is because we said “take the mean of ages and do not remove the NAs.” We can’t know the mean of ages when we are missing an age, so we need to remove the unknown in order to be able to do a calculation. Try the na.rm with the calculations we performed above. max(ages, na.rm = TRUE) min(ages, na.rm = TRUE) median(ages, na.rm = TRUE) summary(ages, na.rm = TRUE) Another interesting feature is that we can do comparisons like greater than and smaller than in R. Let’s compare one age with many ages. old_threshold &lt;- 30 ages &gt; old_threshold ages &lt; old_threshold table(ages &gt; old_threshold) This can be very useful right? Let’s make an even larger vector and learn some tricks to do so. Sometimes it can be hard to type out each individual number hundreds of times so let’s take a look below at what are some other ways to look at vectors. a &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) b &lt;- 1:1000 d &lt;- seq(0, 1000000, by = 10000) length(d) Up until this point we have focused on numbers which are numeric, but we can also work with words which we refer to as strings. Let’s create a vector with some names of people and call it people and explore the names. Note: while you may want to name it names, R already has a function called names, and we want to avoid naming variables and vectors after functions. Just like we don’t want to make a variable called mean or min. people &lt;- c(&#39;Michael&#39;, &#39;Nika&#39;, &#39;Delana&#39;) people == &#39;Matthew&#39; people == &#39;Nika&#39; table(people == &#39;Nika&#39;) &#39;John&#39; %in% people &#39;John&#39; == people Exercises Use R like a calculator 1. Type a command in the Console to determine the sum of 596 and 198. 2. Re-run the sum of 596 and 198 without re-typing it. 3. Recall the command again, but this time adjust the code to find the sum of 596 and 298. 4. Practice escaping an accidentally called command: recall your most recent command, then press the right key to clear the Console’s command line.   Recalling commands 5. Find the sum of the ages of everyone in your immediate family. 6. Now recall that command and adjust it to determine the average age of the members of your family. 7. Find the square root of pi and round the answer to the 2 decimal places.   Finding errors 8. This line of code won’t run; instead, R will wait for more with a + symbol. Find the problem and re-write the code so that it works. 5 * 6 + 9. The same goes for this line of code. Fix it, too. sqrt(16 10. This line of code will trigger an error. Find the problem and re-write the code so that it works. round(100/3,digits+3) 11. Type a command of your own into R that throws an error, then recall the command and revise so that R can understand it.   Show that the following statements are TRUE: 12. pi is greater than the square root of 9 13. It is FALSE that the square root of 9 is greater than pi 14. pi rounded to the nearest whole number equals the square root of 9   Asking TRUE / FALSE questions 15. Write and run a line of code that asks whether these two calculations return the same result: 2*7 - 2*5 / 2 (2*7 - 2*5) / 2 [1] 2 16. Now write and run a line of code that asks whether the first calculation is larger than the second:   R and RStudio: what’s the difference? These two entities are similar, but it is important to understand how they are different. In short, R is an open-source (i.e., free) coding language: a powerful programming engine that can be used to do really cool things with data. R Studio, in contrast, is a free user interface that helps you interact with R. If you think of R as an engine, then it helps to think of RStudio as the car that makes it easier and more comfortable to use the engine to get where you want to go. RStudio needs R in order to function, but R can technically be used on its own outside of RStudio if you want. However, just as a good car mechanic can get an engine to run without being installed within a car, using R on its own is a bit clunky and requires some expertise. For beginners (and everyone else, really), R is just so much more pleasant to use when you are operating it from within RStudio. RStudio als has increasingly powerful features that make R even more useful and versatile in data science. For instance you can make an interactive data dashboard, beautifyl and reproducible data reports, presentations, websites, and even this book! And new features are regularly being added to RStudio by its all-star team of data scientists. That’s why we will always use RStudio´ when working withR` in this book. Two-minute tour of RStudio When you open RStudio, you will see a window that looks like the screenshot below: Console You are already acquainted with RStudio’s Console, the window pane on the left that you use to “talk” to R. Environment In the top right pane, the Environment, RStudio will maintain a list of all the datasets, variables, and functions that you are using as you work. The next modules will explain what variables and functions are. Files, Plots, Packages, &amp; Help You will use the bottom right pane very often. The Files tab lets you see all the files within your working directory, which will be explained in the section below. The Plots tab lets you see the plots you are producing with your code. The Packages tab lets you see the packages you currently have installed on your computer. Packages are bundles of R functions downloaded from the internet; they will be explained in detail a few modules down the road. The Help tab is very important! It lets you see documentation (i.e., user’s guides) for the functions you use in your code. Functions will also be explained in detail a few modules down the road. These three panes are useful, but the most useful window pane of all is actually missing when you first open RStudio. This important pane is where you work with scripts.

In order to make a plot we need a piece of paper or a canvas. So let’s make a canvas: 5. To get started, let’s make some bar plots. 6. Great! Now let’s make a different kind of plot. First, draw your x axis and your y axis (a.k.a. make your coordinates). Ask yourself: What do I want to see? 7. Map the data to the coordinates. Here we will map the data to the coordinates using points. Ask yourself: How do I want to show what I want to see? 8. What if you want to color code these points? Now you’re choosing what else you want to see and how. 9. Add some labels. ggplot() automatically added axis titles and a legend, but we can add some more using the labs() function. Let’s add an overhead title, a sub-title, and a caption. 10. We can also make separate plots for a variable by faceting. 11. Let’s stylize the plot with a different theme. 12. Ready for something different? Let’s make a histogram. 13. As you can see, we can make a lot of different types of charts in R. You can even make a new variable and use it in your plot, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. So let’s learn by doing rather than lecturing and move on to a new dataset. Demography exercises We’re going to work with some anonymized demography data, for both households and individuals. Let’s start by creating a new script, naming it demography.R, and reading in some data as shown below: library(tidyverse) households &lt;- readr::read_csv(&#39;https://datatrain.cc/data/anonymized_demography.csv&#39;) people &lt;- readr::read_csv(&#39;https://datatrain.cc/data/anonymized_demography_individuals.csv&#39;) What is the average age of people? On average, who is older: men or women? How many children are there in the dataset? Make a histogram of age. Make a smoothed histogram using geom_density of age. Make a smoothed histogram of age, but make different “fill” colors for men and women. Make a point chart wherein the x-axis is sex and the y-axis is age. Replace geom_point with geom_jitter so that the points don’t overlap so much. Make the points semi-transparent. Make the points twice as large. Give the plot a title, an x label, and a y label. Add a “violin” plot to the plot. Move the violin to behind the points. Make the points colored by sex. Replace the violin chart with a boxplot. What is the breakdown of household heads and sex (i.e., what number and percentage of household heads are male vs female)? Make a bar chart showing the number of households which are headed by men vs women. What is the average age of household heads who are female vs. the average age of household heads who are male? Make a chart showing the distribution of household heads’ age, which shows both males and females separately. What do you think explains this difference in age? Make a new variable indicating whether the household head is the oldest person in their household or not. What percentage of female household heads are the oldest person in their household? And males? What is the age of the youngest household head? Create a simple scatter plot with longitude as the x value and latitude as the y value. Make a table showing the distribution of wall types. Make a chart to replace the above table. Which fieldworker visited the most households? Which cluster has the most cattle? On what date were most households visited? Gapminder exercises This review exercise is useful immediately after you learn ggplot2 and dplyr.   First, let’s read in some data on health from the World Bank: library(readr) library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(gapminder) gm &lt;- gapminder::gapminder 1. How many rows are in the dataset? 2. How many columns are in the dataset? 3. What are the names of the columns? 4. What is the oldest year in the dataset? 5. What is the country/year with the greatest population in the dataset? 6. Get the average GDP per capita for each continent in 1952. 7. Get the average GDP per capita for each continent for the most recent year in the dataset. 8. Average GDP is a bit misleading, since it does not take into account the relative size (in population) of the different countries (ie, China is a lot bigger than Cambodia). Look up the function weighted.mean. Use it to get the average life expectancy by continent for the most recent year in the dataset, weighted by population.   9. Make a barplot of the above table (ie, average life expectancy by continent, weighted by population). 10. Make a point plot in which the x-axis is country, and the y-axis is GDP. Add the line theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) in order to make the x-axis text vertically aligned. What’s the problem with this plot? How many points are there per country? 11. Make a new version of the above, but filter down to just the earliest year in the dataset. 12. Make a scatterplot of life expectancy and GDP per capita, just for 1972. 13. Make the same plot as above, but for the most recent year in the data. 14. Make the same plot as the above, but have the size of the points reflect the population. 15. Make the same plot as the above, but have the color of the points reflect the continent.   16. Filter the data down to just the most recent year in the data, and make a histogram (geom_histogram) showing the distribution of GDP per capita. 17. Get the average GDP per capita for each continent/year, weighted by the population of each country. 18. Using the data created above, make a plot in which the x-axis is year, the y-axis is (weighted) average GDP per capita, and the color of the lines reflects the content. 19. Make the same plot as the above, but facet the plot by continent. 20. Make the same plot as the above, but remove the coloring by continent.   21. Make a plot showing France’s population over time. 22. Make a plot showing all European countries’ population over time, with color reflecting the name of the country. 23. Create a variable called status. If GDP per capita is over 20,000, this should be “rich”; if between 5,000 and 20,000, this should be “middle”; if this is less than 5,000, this should be “poor”. 24. Create an object with the number of rich countries per year. 25. Create an object with the percentage of countries that were rich each year.   26. Create a plot showing the percentage of countries which were rich each year. 27. Create an object with the number of people living in poor countries each year. 28. Create a chart showing the number of people living in rich, medium, and poor countries per year (line chart, coloring by status). 29. Create a chart showing the life expectancy in Somalia over time. 30. Create a chart showing GDP per capita in Somalia over time.   31. Create a histogram of life expectancy for the most recent year in the data. Facet this chart by continent. 32. Create a barchart showing average continent-level GDP over time, weighted for population, with one bar for each year, stacked bars with the color of the bars indicating continent (geom_bar(position = 'stack')). 33. Create the same chart as above, but with bars side-by-side (geom_bar(position = 'dodge')) 34. Generate 3-5 more charts / tables that show interesting things about the data. 35. Make the above charts as aesthetically pleasing as possible. Exercises with world health data Start by reading in your data. Explore the data, and write 3 questions you’d like to ask it. Answer the questions with tables. Answer the questions with charts. "],["exploring-sanitation.html", "Module 7 Exploring sanitation", " Module 7 Exploring sanitation In the world of data science and public health, we have to work as a team to solve problems. Today you are going to apply what you’ve learned about dplyr and ggplot to learn about sanitation around the world. Good luck! 1. Make a folder in your datalab folder on your desktop and call it sanitation. 2. Open up an RScript and name it sanitation.R and save it into your sanitation folder. 3. In your RScript copy the following questions 4-7 and answer them as a team. 4. Look up improved vs. unimproved sanitation. What kind of sanitation does the US use, improved, unimproved or both? 5. What is open defecation? Is it a type of improved or unimproved sanitation? 6. Is open defecation bad or good? Why or why not? 7. Why do some countries have high rates of open defecation and others do not? 8. Now that you know a bit about sanitation, let’s start looking at some data. Download the dataset shared with you on slack (sanitation.csv) and save it to your sanitation folder. 9. STOP! WE WILL DO THIS TOGETHER! In your sanitation.R script underneath your questions, copy and paste the following line of code and inside the quotes hit tab. Then follow your files until you are in your sanitation folder which is inside your datalab folder on your desktop. If it is not there, go back and re-do questions 1 and 2 above (don’t forget to comment your script!): # set working directory setwd(&quot;&quot;) 10. Write code to load the tidyverse. 11. Now load sanitation.csv into R and assign it a name using the following line of code: # load in the data sanitation &lt;- read_csv(&#39;sanitation.csv&#39;) 12. What are the column names and based on these column names what is this dataset about? 13. Make a table of the World Bank’s income classifications. STOP! WE WILL DO THE NEXT FEW QUESTIONS TOGETHER! 14. Since working with really long column names with spaces is really hard, let’s change the column names together. 15. Let’s look at data for the most recent year. 16. To make it easier to explore the most recent data, let’s name this dataset latest. 17. Using latest, how many countries are there? 18. How many countries are there from each continent? 19. How many countries are there from each income group? 20. Let’s look at data for the low-income countries in Asia. How have their open defecation rates changed over time? Let’s talk through this together before writing any code! RESUME WORKING WITH YOUR GROUP NOW! 21. Make a line graph of safely managed sanitation services over the years in India. 22. Make a line graph of open defecation rates over the years for the country of your choice. 23. Using latest, make a scatterplot showing GDP per capita versus open defecation rates. Color the points by income group and give your plot good labels. 24. Now create separate panels showing the same scatterplots by continent. 25. To make these scatterplots nicer, let’s move the legends and reorder the income groups. We’ll do this one together! 26. To learn another new thing, let’s make a bar chart of sanitation services for South America. Then improve it by filling by income group. 27. Now make a bar chart of sanitation services for the continent of your choice. Remember to fill by income group! 28. Using latest, make a scatterplot showing rural versus urban open defecation rates. Color the points in an informative way and give your plot good labels. 29. Put the sanitation data for the first year in sanitation in an object called oldest. 30. Recreate the visuals above using oldest and compare the results to what you got with latest. What’s changed? What hasn’t changed? "],["making-maps.html", "Module 8 Making maps Exploring features with osmdata Exploring census tracts with tidycensus", " Module 8 Making maps Maps are great for exploring geographic data, like the prevalences of diseases in different countries or the demographics of voting districts in different states. In addition to being efficient data visualizations, well-made maps are beautiful! 1. Open a new R script and name it maps.R 2. Install the following libraries: sf, rnaturalearth, rnaturalearthhires, rnaturalearthdata, tmap, osmdata, and tidycensus 3. Now that you’ve installed these libraries, write code to load them along with dplyr. 4. The first thing you have to do to make a map is to get the underlying geospatial data – we’ll use the rnaturalearth packages to streamline this step, which can sometimes be quite challenging! Since you met people from KEMRI this morning, let’s start by getting the data we need for a map of Kenya: kenya &lt;- ne_countries( country = &quot;Kenya&quot;, returnclass = &quot;sf&quot; ) 5. Look at the data in the kenya object to get a feel for what’s there. How many columns are there? What are their names? 6. For right now, the most important column is the one called geometry. Let’s look at it: kenya$geometry 7. This tells us what kind of geospatial data we’ve got: a polygon. This also tells us how to make our map! tm_shape( kenya ) + tm_polygons() 8. Great! That’s Kenya. Not a very exciting map, though – let’s make it better and more interactive: # get a good background : tmap_options( basemaps = providers$OpenStreetMap ) # make the map interactive : tmap_mode( &quot;view&quot; ) # make a map of Kenya with a nice transparency setting : tm_shape( kenya ) + tm_polygons( alpha = 0.5 ) 9. Time to try something new: with your partner, get the data you need and make a map of Mozambique. 10. Countries are not just monoliths – they have constituent states or districts. Let’s get a more detailed map of Kenya: kenya_states &lt;- ne_states( country = &quot;Kenya&quot;, returnclass = &quot;sf&quot; ) tm_shape( kenya_states ) + tm_polygons( alpha = 0.5 ) 11. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could see the names of the states easily? Great idea! tm_shape( kenya_states ) + tm_polygons( alpha = 0.5, id = &quot;name&quot; ) 12. Update your map of Mozambique to show its districts with their names. 13. What if you want to make a map of all of Africa? That’s easy, too, once you have the right geospatial data. Let’s start big: world &lt;- ne_countries( scale = &quot;medium&quot;, returnclass = &quot;sf&quot; ) tm_shape( world ) + tm_polygons( alpha = 0.5 ) 14. Explore the names of the columns in world. How can we get the countries in Africa? Use your dplyr skills! 15. Make a map of South America, with country names shown when you mouse over them. 16.

Explore the data a bit – what other information could we show on our map? Let’s do it! Maps like these, with regions colored according to some data, are called choropleths. Making one usually involves three steps: get the geospatial dataset you need, get the dataset with the other data you want to show, and add the other data to the geospatial dataset. We’ll go through these steps together once, then you and your partner will go through them with some new data to make your own choropleth. 5. Create an object called world that has polygons for all of the world’s countries. (Review what we did before!) 6. Remove Antarctica from world – this will make our map look nicer later. 7. Make a map of the world (excluding Antarctica). 8. Using the pop_est variable in world, update your world map and color the countries according to their populations.

Tomorrow is another day. And right now is a moment in time that has changed to another moment in time, from one second to the next.” - Anonymous Learning goals Be able to read dates, and convert objects to dates Be able to convert dates, extract useful information, and modify them Use date times Gain familiarity with the lubridate package Hadley Wickham’s tutorial on dates starts with 3 simple questions and some useful observations: Does every year have 365 days? Does every day have 24 hours? Does every minute have 60 seconds? I’m sure you know that not every year has 365 days, but do you know the full rule for determining if a year is a leap year? (It has three parts.) You might have remembered that many parts of the world use daylight savings time (DST), so that some days have 23 hours, and others have 25. You might not have known that some minutes have 61 seconds because every now and then leap seconds are added because the Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing down. Dates and times are hard because they have to reconcile two physical phenomena (the rotation of the Earth and its orbit around the sun) with a whole raft of geopolitical phenomena including months, time zones, and DST. This chapter won’t teach you every last detail about dates and times, but it will give you a solid grounding of practical skills that will help you with common data analysis challenges. Getting to work First, open an RScript, name it dates and times.R and set your working directory. Install the lubridate package and load the library. install.packages(&#39;lubridate&#39;) library(lubridate) library(dplyr) Getting familar with dates Get today’s date using: today() Then make today into an object called today. Even though today looks like a simple character string, it is not. There are all sorts of date-time calculations in the background. To demonstrate this, let’s bring in a simple string. Make variables called my_bday and my_partners_bday using the following format (but adjust to match your actual birthdays!): my_birthday &lt;- &#39;2003-06-09&#39; my_partners_bday &lt;- &#39;2004-02-18&#39; If you run str(my_birthday) and str(today), do you see any major differences? (talk amongst your group) Note that class type of the variable impacts what you can do with the text. For instance, the following causes an error… today - my_birthday Try re-running the calculation above after running the following line of code: my_birthday &lt;- as_date(my_birthday) Why did it work? Now convert my_partners_bday to the right class, then calculate the time between your birthdays. The datetime class When you are working with a datetime object, you can add and subtract time to it. Let’s make a variable that has the time as of right now and then look at it: n &lt;- now() n This is how you can add or subtract seconds to now: n + seconds(1) Add or subtract hours: n - hours(5) Want to only see the date of now? Try this: as_date(n) Look at how time flies when you’re having fun: later &lt;- now() later Calculate how long it took you from when you created now until you created the variable later. Common tasks Converting words (strings) to dates The lubridate package was built to handle dates of various input formats. The following functions convert a character with a particular format into a standard datetime object: ymd(&quot;2017-01-31&quot;) This also works if the single-digit dates are not padded with a 0: ymd(&quot;2017-1-31&quot;) Other formats can also be handled. Try to find a way to make the following into date formats: &quot;2017-31-01&quot; &quot;January 31st, 2017&quot; &quot;31-Jan-2017&quot; Hint: try re-organising the letters from ymd which stands for “year month day”. Extracting components from dates Let’s practice extracting information from the following datetime object: datetime &lt;- ymd_hms(&quot;2016-07-08 12:34:56&quot;) year(datetime) Get the month: month(datetime) Get the day of the month: mday(datetime) Get the day of the year: yday(datetime) Get the day of the week: wday(datetime) Get the name of the day of the week: weekdays(datetime) Get the hour of the day: hour(datetime) Get the minute of the hour: minute(datetime) Get the seconds of the minute: second(datetime) Dealing with time zones When working with dates and times in R, time zones can be a major pain, but the lubridate package tries to simplify this. Adjust timezones for dates: # Today&#39;s date where I am today() # Today&#39;s date in New Zealand today( tzone = &#39;NZ&#39; ) Adjust time zones for date-times: # Time where I am now() # Time in UTC / GMT (which are synonymous) now(&#39;UTC&#39;) now(&#39;GMT&#39;) Don’t know what time zone your computer is working in? Use this function: Sys.timezone() To get a list of time zones accepted in R, use the function OlsonNames (there are about 500 options): OlsonNames() %&gt;% head(50) If you ever need to force the timezone of a datetime object to change without actually changing the date or time, use the function force_tz(): # Get current time in UTC/GMT n &lt;- now(&#39;UTC&#39;) n # Change timezone to Central Standard Time without changing time: force_tz(n, tzone=&#39;America/Chicago&#39;) Using timestamps instead One way to avoid timezone issues is to convert a datetime object to a numeric timestamp. Timestamps record the number of seconds that have passed since midnight GMT on January 1, 1970. It doesn’t matter which timezone you are standing in the seconds that have passed since that moment will be the same: # Time where I am now() %&gt;% as.numeric() What is the difference between the line of code above and now()? Timestamps can simplify things when you are doing a lot of adding and subtracting with time. Timestamps are just seconds; they are just numbers. So they are much less of a black box than datetimeobjects. You can always convert from a timestamp back into a datetimeobject: # Convert to timestamp ts &lt;- now() %&gt;% as.numeric() ts # Convert back to datetime object ts %&gt;% as_datetime() Exercises Create datetime objects Use the appropriate lubridate function to parse each of the following dates (aka make each of the following strings into dates): 1. January 1, 2010 2. 2015-Mar-07 3. 06-Jun-2017 4. c('August 19 (2015)', 'July 1 (2015)') 5. 12/30/14 Extracting datetime components Work with this date: dt &lt;- &#39;2000-01-04 03:43:01&#39; 6. Make a variable with the following name with the corresponding information using the date above: raw (containing the original string) year month dom(day of month) doy (day of year) hour minutes seconds 7. Now calculate two more variables: timestamp diff(the difference, in days, between this time and midnight GMT on January 1, 1970) Some common uses of datetime 8.

If you don’t learn how to edit and transform text-based fields within datasets, you’ll quickly get stuck in R. Think of dates, GPS coordinates, user IDs, group names, plot labels, etc. All of these forms of data can contain non-numeric text. Becoming comfortable working with text in R is an absolutely essential part of your R toolkit. Here we will present the most common functions for working with text. Remember that R has a special object class for text, known as the character class, and that character objects are often referred to as strings. Most of these functions come pre-installed in R. However, several of the tools we will show here (as well as many other useful tools that we will not detail here) come from the stringr package. Go ahead and install stringr and load it using library(). install.packages(&quot;stringr&quot;) library(stringr) Most common tools paste() &amp; paste0() paste() and paste0() combine two or more strings together into a single object: i &lt;- 10 n &lt;- 96 file_name &lt;- &quot;this_file.csv&quot; paste(i,&quot;of&quot;,n,&quot;: Processing&quot;,file_name,&quot;. . . &quot;) Notice that paste() separates terms with a blank space; you’ll see in a moment that paste0() does not separate terms. Here’s the same input but with paste0() instead: paste0(i,&quot;of&quot;,n,&quot;: Processing&quot;,file_name,&quot;. . . &quot;) To replicate the original output with paste(), you manually add blank spaces like this: paste0(i,&quot; of &quot;,n,&quot;: Processing &quot;,file_name,&quot; . . . &quot;) You can also use paste() to collapse multiple objects into a single string. x &lt;- 1:10 paste(x,collapse=&quot;;&quot;) Make an object called ages that has the ages of everyone in your group, then use paste and collapse to list these ages. tolower() &amp; toupper() tolower() and toupper() force all text in a string to lower case or upper case, respectively. Run the following: x &lt;- &quot;That Tree Is Far Away.&quot; tolower(x) toupper(x) What happens if you change x to \"That Tree Is 5 Meters Away.\" Does it still work? nchar() nchar() returns the number of characters within a string. How many characters are in x? nchar(x) substr() substr() trims a string according to a start and end character position. Run the following: dates &lt;- c(&quot;2021-03-01&quot;, &quot;2021-03-02&quot;, &quot;2021-03-03&quot;) substr(dates,1,4) # years substr(dates,6,7) # months substr(dates,9,10) # days What do the numbers in substr correspond to in the dates list? grep() grep() returns the elements in a character vector that contain a given pattern. Run the following: years &lt;- 1900:1999 # Which elements correspond to the 1980s? eighties &lt;- grep(&quot;198&quot;,years) eighties years[eighties] grepl() grepl() tells you which elements in a character vector contain a given pattern. Run the following: some_names &lt;- c(&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Boba Fett&quot;, &quot;Leia&quot;, &quot;Robert&quot;, &quot;Yoda&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Not Bob&quot;, &quot;Robin&quot;, &quot;Catwoman&quot;, &quot;Bobtown&quot;, &quot;Zinnia&quot;) # Which names contain &quot;Bob&quot;? bobs &lt;- grepl( pattern = &quot;Bob&quot;, x=some_names, fixed = TRUE) bobs some_names[bobs] Look for other patterns, like “ob”, “man”, etc. Be creative! Baller move for future reference: use grepl inside filter to find what you want! gsub() gsub() replaces a given pattern with another in a character vector. Run the following: dates &lt;- c(&quot;2021-03-01&quot;,&quot;2021-03-02&quot;,&quot;2021-03-03&quot;) gsub(&quot;-&quot;,&quot;/&quot;,dates) Instead of /, put . between the year, month, day. str_pad() stringr::str_pad(): standardize the lengths of strings by “padding” it (e.g., with zeroes). Run the following: days &lt;- as.character(1:15) days stringr::str_pad(days,width=2,side=&quot;left&quot;,pad=&quot;0&quot;) What happens if you change side to “right”? str_split() stringr::str_split(): split a string into several strings at the occurrence of a specified character. dates &lt;- c(&quot;2021-03-01&quot;,&quot;2021-03-02&quot;,&quot;2021-03-03&quot;) splits &lt;- stringr::str_split(dates,&quot;-&quot;) splits This function returns a list for every element in the original vector. A common need is to retrieve one item from each of the elements in this list. For example, let’s say you are trying to retrieve the months of each element in the dates vector. The list structure makes this tricky to retrieve. Here’s the way to do it by drawing upon the apply() family of functions: sapply(splits, &quot;[[&quot;, 1) # years sapply(splits, &quot;[[&quot;, 2) # Months sapply(splits, &quot;[[&quot;, 3) # days as.character() as.character(): converts a non-character object into a character string. x &lt;- c(1,2,3) as.character(x) x &lt;- as.factor(c(&quot;group1&quot;,&quot;group2&quot;,&quot;group3&quot;)) as.character(x) This can be particularly useful when trying to resolve problems caused by factors. One common issue occurs when R mistakes a set of numbers as a set of factors. Using as.character() can set things right: x &lt;- as.factor(c(18,19,20)) x If you try to convert straight to numeric, it does not work: as.numeric(x) So convert to character first: as.numeric(as.character(x)) Exercises To practice these tools, we will play with the results of a past DataLab survey. Read the survey into R as follows: library(dplyr) library(gsheet) survey &lt;- gsheet2tbl(&#39;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iVt9FX9J2iv3QFKBM7Gzb9dgva70XrW1lxMV4hpekeo/edit?resourcekey#gid=204634767&#39;) To make this spreadsheet easier to work with, let’s rename the columns. Currently, the columns are: names(survey) Rename them like so: names(survey) &lt;- c(&#39;time&#39;, &#39;sex&#39;, &#39;age&#39;,&#39;sib&#39;, &#39;dad_mus&#39;, &#39;person_mus&#39;, &#39;joe_mus_is&#39;, &#39;eyesight&#39;, &#39;height&#39;, &#39;shoe_size&#39;, &#39;bday&#39;, &#39;money_or_love&#39;, &#39;rps_skill&#39;, &#39;num_pan&#39;, &#39;cats_dogs&#39;, &#39;first_name&#39;, &#39;last_name&#39;) 1.

"],["getting-started-with-rmarkdown.html", "Module 12 Getting started with RMarkdown What is RMarkdown? Why? What can you do with RMarkdown? Raw RMarkdown example Exercises Make a Markdown CV", " Module 12 Getting started with RMarkdown Learning goals How to document your projects with RMarkdown and why doing so is so important. This is a meta-tutorial for using RMarkdown, a “syntax” for writing beautiful reports with simple text files. This tutorial, which was written in RMarkdown, has been provided twice: first, as its formatted ‘book-ready’ form, and second as the raw text file used to write it. What is RMarkdown? RMarkdown lets you write documents formatted with fancy HTML (the main language used to create websites) without having to know how to write HTML code. Instead, you just need to know how to use a few common symbols. Why? RMarkdown was created because most data scientists used to document their code and data projects with simple text files (.txt). Text files are designed to be simple, so they have no special formatting: no nice fonts, no headings, no bold, no italics, no bullet lists. And, as a result of their simplicity, text files are (1) boring and (2) difficult to organize. RMarkdown is the perfect solution: it translates a simple text file into a beautifully formatted report. Recall that, in order for your research to be truly reproducible, you have to document your work thoroughly. Doing so requires two things: First, that you provide a detailed description of your work in a simple text file, and second, that your documentation be well-organized and enjoyably legible. Think about it: if your documentation is incomplete, impossible to navigate, and difficult to read, can you really say that your project is reproducible? What can you do with RMarkdown? First of all, RMarkdown… Lets you organize your report into sections and subsections. Lets you italicize and emphasize certain sections of your work. Lets you distinguish between normal text and code or filenames. Lets you write large chunks of code, like the one below. # This is a large chunk of code. x &lt;- 1:10 y &lt;- 15:20 z &lt;- x + y Also, RMarkdown … Lets you weave together your documentation with R code that actually runs (this is called RMarkdown, which is covered in the next module), opening up possibilities for automatic reporting and truly reproducible research publications. Lets you produce publication-ready articles and books, since there is a world of open-source formatting templates available to you. Lets you add hyperlinks. Lets you type HTML code directly into the same document, if you want to. Lets you include images, like the one below. Common RMarkdown mistakes When you try to make a section heading (e.g., ## New section), you forget to put a space between the hashtags and the name of the section. When you try to begin a new paragraph, you don’t add two spaces at the end of your sentence. (Without those two spaces, RMarkdown will assume you are still working in the same paragraph.) The same thing happens often when making a list. Without two spaces at the end of each item, the items might not get placed on new lines. When you try to begin a new paragraph, you don’t add an empty line between your paragraphs. Raw RMarkdown example Below we provide the raw textfile we used to write the section above. # `Markdown` documentation #### Learning goals {-} - How to document your projects with `Markdown`, and why doing so is so important. &amp;nbsp; This is a **meta-tutorial** for using `Markdown`, a &quot;syntax&quot; for writing *beautiful* reports with simple text files.

Exercises Open a new, blank RMarkdown document: 1. In RStudio, go to the top left dropbown menu for making a new file (look for the green plus sign.) 2. Select “R Markdown…” 3. Save this file as test.Rmd in your datalab folder. The prefix, .Rmd, specifies that this text file should be interpreted as a RMarkdown file. Once you save the file, you should see some new options appear, one of which is preview. 4. At the top of your test.Rmd file, write: # Title 5. Click the Knit button and see if a RMarkdown file is produced. Make your own RMarkdown: Use the RMarkdown example above, which you can compare to the formatted version at the top of this module, to figure out how to add the following elements to your document. Use the Knit button to test if your entries are doing what you want them to. 6. Write a silly sentence. 7. Make a word in that sentence italicized. 8. Make a word in that sentence boldface. 9. Add the first section to your document. Name it whatever you want. 10. Add a sentence in this new section, formatting one of its words as a piece of code. 11. Start a new paragraph and add another sentence. 12. Start a third paragraph and add vertical space between it and the previous paragraph. 13. Add a multi-line chunk of code. 14. Download a silly meme from the internet and add it to your document. (Hint: you will have to place that image file in the same folder as your Markdown file.) 15. Add another subsection to the subsection you are working in. Name it “Grocery List”. 16. Type out an enumerated grocery list. 17. Add another subsection, this time at the same hierarchichal level as the one you created in step 9. Name it “Bucket List”. 18. Create a bullet list of things you want to accomplish before you die. 19. Make one of your list items act as a link to another website. Make a Markdown CV It is increasingly common for data scientists to have a Markdown version of their CV posted as its own page. Check out these examples: Here Also here And here! Maintaining your CV this way can be very efficient. It is easy to format and easy to update. And, most importantly, rather than have various versions of your CV on your computer or in GoogleDrive, you can just share a link to your live, published CV. What better way to demonstrate your skillset in a reproducible, professional-quality research?

Let’s go! OWID COVID-19 data, Part 1 1. We’re going to work with the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset, which is hosted on GitHub (more on that soon!). Go there and download the CSV to your DataLab folder. Also, download the codebook for convenient reference. 2. Before doing anything else, visit Our World in Data’s COVID-19 Data Explorer and explore some of their visualizations. Together, we’ll decide what to analyze and visualize – at the very least, we’ll create some summaries and a couple of maps. 3. Open a new RMarkdown file called covid.Rmd and save it in your DataLab folder. 4. Give your file a good title, add your name as author, and delete everything below the setup chunk that sets knitr options (i.e., everything after line 11). 5. knit your file. The output should just consist of your title, your name, and today’s date. 6. In the setup R chunk, edit the knitr options and turn off echo, message, and warning. 7. In the setup R chunk, add code to load the libraries tidyverse, sf, and tmap. Depending on what we choose to do, we might need to load some additional libraries. 8. In the setup chunk, add code to load both the dataset and the codebook that you downloaded in step 1. above. 9. knit your file again to make sure that everything is still working. Note how RStudio saves your RMarkdown file each time you knit it! 9. Add a section called Introduction where we will outline the analysis we’re going to do. A few bullet points will probably be useful here! 10. Let’s do our analysis, organizing our results into sections and subsections as we go. 11. Once we’re happy with the results (or we run out of time, whichever comes first), let’s create an RMarkdown presentation of our findings. OWID COVID-19 data, Part 2 With a partner, put together a new RMarkdown analysis using the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset. Create both a report and a slide deck that you’ll present together. "],["git-github.html", "Module 14 Git + GitHub Why What is there to Git? GitHub set up Create a new repository Clone a repository Working in a repository Exercises Editing the .gitignore file Further resources", " Module 14 Git + GitHub Learning goals The importance of keeping your code somewhere How to install Git How to install GitHub How to use Git on your own How to use Git as a team Why Perhaps you are familiar with this… Or this… What is there to Git? Think of Git like Google Drive…but better. I assume that your Google Drive has tons of documents on it organised into folders. You most likely use Google Drive to save your documents, but sometimes you also edit those documents. If you wanted, you could go and look at a previous version of the document by tracking changes (a cool feature of Google). But what exactly am I gitting at? Git is very similar to Google Drive. You can track changes to your documents, organize documents, share documents, and review changes. However, instead of putting your Word documents or your powerpoints on Git (which you can do), us coders use Git to store our code. Let’s store the code that we have worked on so far on Git. GitHub set up Go to www.github.com and create a user account. Create a new repository Once you’ve created an account and logged in to GitHub, let’s create a repository. What is a repository? Basically, it’s a coding project in the form of a folder. Having logged into git, click the “plus” icon in the upper right and then click “New repository” (or go directly here). You can fill in the “Repository name” field with whatever you’d like. For the following examples, we’ll use the word “testrepo”. Fill in the “Description” field with the word “My first git repository”. Set the repo as “Public” (unless you plan on putting any secrets here!), and then click the “Add a README file” checkbox. Finally, click “Create repository”. Cool! You’ve now created your first git repository. It’s public url is https://github.com/&lt;YOUR USERNAME&gt;/&lt;repo-name&gt;. Others can see your code there, and you can too. Clone a repository Your new repo exists on the internet, but does not yet exist on your local machine. In order to get “testrepo” on your computer, you’ll need to do something that you’ll only do once: “clone” the repo. “Cloning” in git-speak means creating a copy of the repository locally. To clone, you’ll first open Rstudio. Now, what we are going to do is put the folder that we made online on GitHuband put this same folder onto our machine. Click File in RStudio and click New Project.... Click the Version Control option. Side note: the word Version Control comes from the term Version Control systems (VCS), which are software tools meant to help programmers, like you, collaborate, maintain original code, document changes, and keeping track of files. For example, Git is one of the most populatar version control systems. Click the Git option. There? Good. Now in this section, Clone Git Repository, RStudio is asking you for a few things: The first thing it is asking you for is the Repository URL. The Repository URL is the link to the repository you just created on GitHub. The link most likely looks like this: https://github.com/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/&lt;repo-name&gt;. An easier way than just editing this link I gave you is by going back to GitHub online and copying the URL at the top of the page, OR do you see the green button that says &lt;&gt; Code? Click the button and you can copy the web URL or HTTPS link that is staring you in the face. Paste that link in the Repository URL space in RStudio. Next, RStudio asks you for the Project directory name. This should be automatically filled when you paste the Repository URL link and will match the name of your repository on GitHub (e.g. testrepo). Finally, RStudio needs to know where you want this project to be made or where you want this folder to be kept on your laptop. Since this is your first testrun and you are a part of DataLab, let’s save this in your name_datalab folder on your laptop. So where it says Create project as subdirectory of: click Browse and find your name_datalab folder on your DeskTop and choose that location. Click Create Project and watch the magic happen. Now, youve got a folder on your machine namedtestrepo. You can confirm that by looking in yourname_datalabfolder and looking fortestrepo`. See testrepo there? Great! Working in a repository Change some code on your computer In your local testrepo folder, you have a “cloned” copy of the repository at https://github.com//testrepo. As of now, testrepo is a pretty uninteresting folder. The only thing in it is a file named README.md. A “README” file is generally an explanation of a repository’s content, purpose, etc. Like all files, a README can be tracked in git. By tracked I mean we can make edits to the file and save them in GitHub and look back at previous edits. Rather than me explaining, let’s just do it. Let’s open the README file and make a change to it. We’ll add the below line of “code”: This is my first git repository. Then save and close the README file. Send the changes on your computer to GitHub Even though we have made edits to our README.md file on our laptop, GitHub has no idea that we made these changes. So how do we reflect the changes on our laptop online? If you look at the upper right corner of RStudio where your environment is, you will also see a Git button. Click it. This tab is where RStudio and GitHub can interact with each other. In this Git tab, you might notice that you have some items there. If you hover over the yellow question mark, you will see the message Untracked. This untracked message is the computer telling you that you have made changes on the computer that are not online. So, let’s get the change we made on our laptop onto the internet. To get our new edits onto the internet there are two main things we have to do: 1. add our changes 2. commit our changes 3. push our changes Again, let’s learn by doing rather than by reading. Add your changes In the Git tab, click the white piece of paper with a check mark. In this pop-up you will see all of the documents that you edited today. You will see the README.md file which we just wrote on, the testrepo.Rproj that we created, and maybe a .gitignore file which for now we can just ignore like the title says. Of the edits that we made, we want to choose which edits we add to GitHub. Let’s add all of these edits that have been made today to GitHub. To do this you can click the empty square next to the document to make it blue OR you can click the button next to stage at the top of the pop-up. Commit your changes Have you ever heard of the expression commit something to memory? Well, this is what we are going to do with these files we just chose or staged. On the right-hand side of the pop-up you will see a box which at the top says Commit message. In here, type: my first change This tells Git that we are “committing” our change, it marking a checkpoint (to which we can revert later). Almost there. Now that weve added and committed, we need to \"push\" our change toGitHub`. Push the changes in your local repo to GitHub Click the green upper arrow that says Push. You did it! You did it! Go to https://github.com//testrepo and open the README.md file. You’ll notice that your most recent changes are there. Now, if someone else wants to get your code, they can “clone” your repository, and they’ll have the code you’ve “pushed” there. Exercises Create another repo: Let’s face it: testrepo is a pretty lame name for a repository. How about we make a repo that’s actually real and useful? We’ll make one for storing all the code we’re writing in this course. 1) Go to https://github.com/ 2) Click the “plus” icon in the upper right and then click “New repository” (or go directly here). 3) Now, for “Repository name”, write “datalab_2024”. 4) Fill in the “Description” field with the words “Code I wrote during my intro to data science course”. 5) Set the repo as “Public” (unless you plan on putting any secrets here!), and then click the “Add a README file” checkbox. Finally, click “Create repository”. 6) Clone the repo to your computer (name_datalab folder). 7) Create a new R script in your datalab_2024 repository called babynames.R. 8) Load library(babynames) (don’t forget to comment your RScript!). 9) Make an object called bb_names by running bb_names &lt;- babynames. 10) Create a line plot showing the popularity of the name Marie over time. 11) Create a line plot for proportion of the name Joe, colored by sex. Make the lines a bit thicker and more transparent. 12) Add new x and y axis labels, as well as a chart title. 13) Create a bar chart of the 10 most popular female names in 2002. 14) Make the bars transparent and filled with the color blue. 15) Create a new data set called the_nineties that only contains years from the 1990s. 16) Save this dataset to your repository (use write_csv()). 17) Add, commit, and push your files to GitHub. Check GitHub and make sure that your code successfully pushed. 18) In RStudio pull from GitHub. Is it already up to date? 19) Now that everything is up to date, make a visualisation of you and your team member’s names for a year of your choice. 20) Make a visual that looks at your name over time. What happens if you color by sex? 21) Don’t forget to stage/add, commit, and push your hardwork to GitHub! Editing the .gitignore file If you look in your local datalab repo on your laptop, and you might see that there are a lot of documents there! You’re going to want to (i) add, (ii) commit, and (iii) push these documents, but perhaps there are some kinds of documents you don’t want to push. For example, maybe you want to push R code files (.R), but not data files (.csv). In this case, you can explicitly tell git that you don’t want it to pay any attention to .csv files by creating a .gitignore file. A .gitignore file is simply a text file in a git repository that indicates to git that the contents of that file should be ignored. Let’s do it. 18) Open the .gitignore file in RStudio. 19) Add the following line to it: *.csv The star is a “wildcard”, meaning that it stands in place of anything (such as ducks.csv or data.csv or xyz.csv). With this in your repo, git now knows to ignore anything that ends with the extension .csv. Good? Great. 20) Push everything to your repo (remember your 3 steps). Now you can share your code with others, and your future self.

So what is a better way to get to know someone than by learning about their hometown? Today, in your groups you are going to put dots on a map that represent every person’s hometown from your group. Follow this document together as a team to make this map: Make your dataset 1. Make one Google sheet and title it: team_lat_lng with columns first_name, organization, LAT, and LNG. Note: make sure these columns are in this exact order, spelled exactly like this, with LAT and LNG in all caps! 2. Click ‘Share’ in the top right of the google sheet and in ‘General access’ click ‘Anyone with the link’. Note: this is important because in order to read data into R, it must be available to be accessed by everyone. 3. Input everyone’s name, organization (either DataLab or KEMRI), hometown latitude and longitude in the associated columns. To find your latitude and longitude, go to Google Maps, right click your hometown, then input the latitude (the first number) and longitude (the second number) from Google Maps into your Google sheet. As an example, we can tell from the following that Sewanee’s latitude is 35.20318 and Sewanee’s longitude is -85.92203 : Watch out! Just enter numbers for latitudes and longitudes, don’t include any letters indicating north, south, east, or west. Sewanee’s longitude is negative, since Sewanee is west of the prime meridian; Sewanee’s latitude is positive, since Sewanee is north of the equator. All done? Woohoo! You have your dataset! Load in your data 4. For the KEMRI team, make a folder called name_datalab on your desktop (make sure to put your name where I wrote name). Everyone, in your name_datalab folder make another folder called team_map. 5. Everyone open up RStudio, make an RScript called our_map.R, and save it into your team_map folder. 6. Starting now, make sure you comment every line of your script. So make a comment that says # set working directory and set your working directory to your team_map folder. 7. Load the following libraries (if you don’t have them make sure to install them with install.packages(): library(sf) library(tmap) library(tidyverse) library(gsheet) 8. Now, there are two ways to load in your data: Download the Google sheet as a csv file and and save it into your team_map folder. Then in your RScript load in the data and assign it to an object: locations &lt;- read_csv(&#39;team_lat_lng.csv&#39;) In your environment do you have locations? If so, great! Another simpler way to download the data is by using the following: # be sure to put the correct link inside the quotes below! locations &lt;- gsheet::gsheet2tbl(&#39;insert link&#39;) Still have locations after this? Wonderful! Make your map 9. Now that you have your locations object, we have to tell R what to do with it. First, format things correctly: # convert latitude and longitude into a geometry column: locations &lt;- st_as_sf( locations, coords = c(&quot;LNG&quot;, &quot;LAT&quot;), crs = &quot;WGS84&quot; ) 10. Now look at your locations object – you should see that you have POINTs in the geometry column. Since we have points instead of polygons, we need to use tmap’s tm_dots function instead of the tm_polygons function we’ve used to make our other maps. Here’s the code to make an interactive map with color-coded points: tmap_mode( &quot;view&quot; ) tmap_options( basemaps = providers$OpenStreetMap ) tm_shape( locations ) + tm_dots( col=&quot;organization&quot;, palette = &quot;Dark2&quot; ) Share your work Congratulations you did it! Save your image, share it in slack, and make sure everyone on your team has an RScript that works. Once you’ve done this you’re all set. Have a great day or night wherever you are in the world!

Here are a few of its many tidy features: Each row is a single observation. There is not a single missing value anywhere in the dataset. The rows are organized from earliest to most recent, based on the data embedded in the sit column. Categorical columns have standardized formatting. In the species column, there are two levels: HW (humpback whale) and FW (fin whale). In the behavior column, there are also two levels: FEED andOTHER. But this dataset was not always so pretty. Here is the link to the original data file: whales-dives-messy.csv Your task in this review exercise is to write a script that carries out the necessary data cleaning steps to get this dataset from its original form to its tidy form. Test your work along the way, then demonstrate its completion, using the identical() function. If your my_dives version of the dataset is identical to the dives data above, the following logical test will be TRUE: Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;dives&#39; not found Enjoy!
