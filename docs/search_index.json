What this is, and what it isn’t This is not a textbook or an encyclopedia. This is not a reference manual. It is not exhaustive or comprehensive. We won’t mention statistical tests at all. There is almost no theory. In fact, this curriculum is biased, non-representative, and incomplete – by design. So what is this? This guide is an accelerator, an incubator designed to guide you along the most direct path from your first line of code to becoming a capable data scientist. Our goal is to help you through the most dangerous period in your data science education: your very first steps. The first three weeks. That is when 99% percent of people give up on learning to code. But it doesn’t need to be this way. We made this book to reach more than just the 1%. We have based our approach on three core premises: Premise 1: We learn best by doing. Our goal is to get you doing data science. We will keep theory and detail to a minimum. We will give you the absolute basics, then offer you exercises and puzzles that motivate you to learn the rest. Then, once you’ve been doing data science for a bit, you soon begin thinking like a data scientist. By that, we mean tackling ambiguous problems with persistence, independence, and creative problem solving. Premise 2: We learn best with purpose. Once you gain comfort with the basic skills, you will be able to start working on real data, for real projects, with real impact. You will start to care about what you are coding. And that is when the learning curve skyrockets – because you are motivated, and because you are learning reactively, instead of passively. Our goal is to get you to the point of take-off as quickly as possible. Premise 3: A simple toolbox is all you need to build a house. Once you become comfortable with a few basic coding tools, you can build pretty much anything. The toolbox doesn’t need to be that big; if you know how to use your tools well, and if you have enough building supplies (i.e., data), the possibilities are limitless. Who this is for The target audience for these tutorials is the rookie: the student who wants to work with data but has zero formal training in programming, computer science, or statistics. What you will learn The Core theory unit establishes the conceptual foundations and motivations for this work: what data science is, why it matters, and ethical issues surrounding it: the good, the bad, and the ugly. Don’t slog through this all at once. Sprinkle it in here and there. The most important thing, at first, is to start writing code. The next several units comprise a core curriculum for tackling data science problems: The Getting started unit teaches you how to use R (in RStudio). Here you will add the first and most important tools to your toolbox: working with variables, vectors, dataframes, scripts, and file directories. The Basic R workflow unit teaches you how to bring in your own data and work with it in R. You will learn how to produce beautiful plots and how to reorganize, filter, and summarize your datasets. For these first two units, we encourage you to take on these modules one at a time, in the exact order they are presented: we put a lot of thought into what we included in these modules (and what we did not). The Review exercises unit provides various puzzles that allow you to apply the basic R skills from the previous unit to fun questions and scenarios. In each of these exercises, questions are arranged in increasing order of difficulty, so that beginners will not feel stuck right out of the gate, nor will experienced coders become bored. This is where you really begin to cut your teeth on real-world data puzzles: figuring out how to use the R tools in your toolbag to tackle an ambiguous problem and deliver an excellent data product. The Reproducible research unit equips you with basic tools needed for truly reproducible data science: documenting your research and code with Markdown; weaving together your code and your reporting with RMarkdown; allowing users to explore the data themselves with an interactive Shiny dashboard or web app; and sharing your code and tracking versions of your code using Git.
