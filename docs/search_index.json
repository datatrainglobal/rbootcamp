[["index.html", "R Bootcamp Module 1 Welcome What is this website? Who are we?", " R Bootcamp Module 1 Welcome What is this website? This is not a textbook or an encyclopedia. This is not a reference manual. It is not exhaustive or comprehensive. We barely mention statistical tests at all. There is almost no theory. In fact, this curriculum is biased, non-representative, and incomplete – by design. So what is this? This website is a guide designed to help you through the most dangerous period in your data science education: your very first steps. The first few weeks. That is when 99% percent of people give up on learning to code. You want to be part of the 1%? Okay, then you need to understand these 3 things: Premise 1: We learn best by doing. Our goal is to get you doing data science. We will keep theory and detail to a minimum. We will give you the absolute basics, then offer you exercises and puzzles that motivate you to learn the rest. Then, once you’ve been doing data science for a bit, you soon begin thinking like a data scientist. By that, we mean tackling ambiguous problems with persistence, independence, and creative problem solving. With the focus on doing (as opposed to listening, reading, watching, etc.), the burden is on you. You gotta do the work. Premise 2: We learn best with purpose. Once you gain comfort with the basic skills, you will be able to start working on real data, for real projects, with real impact. You will start to care about what you are coding. And that is when the learning curve skyrockets – because you are motivated, and because you are learning reactively, instead of preemptively. Our goal is to get you to the point of take-off as quickly as possible. Premise 3: A simple toolbox is all you need to build a house. Once you become comfortable with a few basic coding tools, you can build pretty much anything. The toolbox doesn’t need to be that big; if you know how to use your tools well, and if you have enough building supplies (i.e., data), the possibilities are limitless. One more thing that this is not: This is not a fancy interactive tutorial with bells or whistles. We purposefully designed this to be simple and “analog”. You will not be typing your code into this website and getting feedback from a robot, or setting up an account to track your progress, or getting pretty merit badges or points when you complete each module. Instead, you will be doing your work on your own machine, working with real folders and files, downloading data and moving it around, etc. – all the things you will be doing as a real data scientist in the real world. Enough talk. Let’s go. Click on “Setting up your computer” and let’s get to work. Who are we? Datatrain (www.datatrain.global) is a project of Databrew (www.databrew.cc).

Let’s go. Install R First, let’s get the right programs installed on your computer. Then we will explain what they are and why you need them. First, download and install R: Go to the following website, click the Download button, and follow the website’s instructions from there. https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/ Install RStudio Second, download and install RStudio: Go to the following website and choose the free Desktop version: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Third, make sure RStudio opens successfully: Open the RStudio app. A window should appear that looks like this: Fourth, make sure R is running correctly in the background: In RStudio, in the pane on the left (the “Console”), type 2+2 and hit Enter. If R is working properly, the number “4” will be printed in the next line down. Finally, some minor adjustments to make RStudio run smoother (and look cooler): Go to Tools &gt; Global Options and make sure your General settings match these exactly: Specifically, uncheck the option under Workspace to ‘Restore .RData into workspace at startup.’ Now go to the Appearance settings and choose a cool theme! Boom! You’ve got R up and running. Now it’s time to install some packages. Install packages Packages are what makes R so great. To install a package, open Rstudio and type the following code into the “Console” in the bottom left Did that work? Probably not, because “packagename” is not a real R package. The packages we’ll be using are the following: tidyverse RColorBrewer leaflet ggthemes rmarkdown sp To install all of these, you can run install.packages for each package: So, now you’ve got R, RStudio, and some cool packages. Good job. You’re ready for the next module. "],["first-code.html", "Module 3 First code Scripts and your workspace R as a calculator Objects", " Module 3 First code Are you ready to write some code? I hope so, because it’s time. Scripts and your workspace In RStudio, click “File” in the upper left and then “New file -&gt; R Script”. This will open a window pane in the upper left of your screen. This “script” is basically a place for you to write and save code. Got it? Good. Now click “File” then “Save as” and then save your script locally somewhere where you’ll remember it. For example, you could save it on your “Desktop” as a file named “firstcode.R”. Your workspace consists of: Your script (upper left). This is where you talk to R. The console (bottom left). This is where R talks back to you. The “environment” (upper right). This is a place where you can explore data “objects” you’ve created (don’t worry, we’ll get there). The “plots” tab (bottom right). This is where you’ll see outputs of charts, maps, etc. R as a calculator At its most basic, R is a big calculator. Or a conversation partner. However you like to think of it. You talk to R by typing some code in your script (upper left), and R talks back by printing something in the console (bottom left). For example, if you want to ask R what two plus two is, you’d write this on line one of your script. 2 + 2 Then, if you place your cursor on that line and run “ctrl + enter” (or “cmd + enter” if on Mac), that code will “run” and R will give you the response. [1] 4 Cool, huh? You can, of course, type more complex math problems. Try typing the following on line 2: 10392 * (13/72)^2 - sqrt(9.123) + (475/2.2)^3 Did you get the below as an answer?

What percentage of males died? What percentage of people who died were male? What percentage of people who survived were male? What percentage of people who died were female?

Populate this variable with the characters “survived” or “died” depending on the survived variable. Make another variable called age_group. If the person is over 18, call them “adult”; otherwise, call them “child”. Make another variable called person_type. Use paste0 to combine the sex and age_group variables, in that order. Make another variable called initial. This should be the first letter of each person’s last name. Hint, use substr. What is the most prevalent initial in the dataset? What is the least prevalent second letter in people’s last names? Use nchar to calculate the number of letters in each person’s name, and make a variable with that value named name_length. Who has the longest name in the dataset? Who has the shortest name in the dataset? Make a variable called above_average_name_length. This should be TRUE if the person’s name length is above average, and false if below or at average. Who is more likely to have survived: those with short names, or those with long names. What is the age of the female with the shortest name who survived? What is the sex of the oldest person to have died who had an above average name length?
