# First code

Are you ready to write some code? I hope so, because it's time.

## File paths

Good organization is the key to success, so let's start by creating a folder for all of your DataLab work. 

... now that you've done this, **REMEMBER WHERE YOUR FOLDER IS AND STAY ORGANIZED!!** 

## Scripts and your workspace {.unnumbered}

In RStudio, click "File" in the upper left and then "New file -> R Script". This will open a window pane in the upper left of your screen. This "script" is basically a place for you to write and save code. Got it? Good.

Now click "File" then "Save as" and then save your script locally somewhere where you'll remember it. For example, you could save it on your "Desktop" as a file named "firstcode.R".

Your workspace consists of:

- Your script (upper left). This is where you talk to R.  
- The console (bottom left). This is where R talks back to you.  
- The "environment" (upper right). This is a place where you can explore data "objects" you've created (don't worry, we'll get there).  
- The "plots" tab (bottom right). This is where you'll see outputs of charts, maps, etc.  

## R as a calculator {.unnumbered}

At its most basic, R is a big calculator. Or a conversation partner. However you like to think of it. You talk to R by typing some code in your script (upper left), and R talks back by printing something in the console (bottom left).

For example, if you want to ask R what two plus two is, you'd write this on line one of your script.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
2 + 2
```

Then, if you place your cursor on that line and run "ctrl + enter" (or "cmd + enter" if on Mac), that code will "run" and R will give you the response.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
2 + 2
```

Cool, huh? You can, of course, type more complex math problems. Try typing the following on line 2:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
10392 * (13/72)^2 - sqrt(9.123) + (475/2.2)^3
```

Did you get the below as an answer?

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
10392 * (13/72)^2 - sqrt(9.123) + (475/2.2)^3
```

Good.

As you can see, some calculations are pretty straightforward, like addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/), and even multiplication (*).

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
4 + 4

4 - 3

12 / 6

10 * 10
```

You can even perform calculations with negative numbers.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
96 + -2 
```

And exponents can be denoted like this.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
2 ^2

100 ^5
```

Make sure you have run all of these in your computer. Done? Great, that's R as a calculator.

## Re-running code {.unnumbered}

Sometimes you may want to re-run a line of code that you just ran or to recall code so that you can adjust it slightly. Click anywhere in the Console and then press your keyboard's Up arrow. That line of code that appears in your Console is the last line of code you just ran. Good work!

Try clicking the Up arrow three times. Do you see the line of code that you ran three times ago? Yes you do. That's because R keeps a history of everything you have said to it since you opened this window. So if you keep pressing your Up arrow, R will show you all of the lines of code you previously ran. 

If you don't want this old command, simply press Escape to reset the Console's command line, and now you're ready to re-run code in the Console.

## Incomplete commands {.unnumbered}

Similar to talking to a friend, if you start a sentence and don't finish it, your friend will get confused. R gets confused when you enter an incomplete command and will wait for you to finish it in the Console before doing anything.

For example, try running this code in your Console:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
45 -
```

Is R giving you a little + sign on the line under your command? That's because it is waiting for you to complete your command.

If you want to complete it, add a number (e.g., 3) and hit Enter. You should now be given an answer (e.g., 42).

Or, if instead you want R to stop waiting and stop running, just press the Escape key

## Getting errors {.unnumbered}

Our commands can't only be complete, but they need to follow the rules of R. We know that if the command is incomplete that R will give us a + sign, but what about when we don't follow the rules of R?

Try running this code in your Console:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
4 + y
```

You probably received a message in red font stating: Error: object 'y' not found. That is because R did know how to interpret the symbol y in this case, so it just gave up. 

If R does not understand your code, it will throw an error and give up on trying to execute that line of code but don't be deterred when you see an error! They happen all the time, even to the professionals. The only thing we can do is read your code, find the errors, and fix them.

Here’s another piece of code that will produce an error (just for fun):

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
dfjkltr9fitwt985ut9e3
```

## Using parentheses {.unnumbered}

Another rule of R pertains to parentheses. Exactly how it is done in math, you can use parentheses to exert control over the order in which you perform calculations. For example, these two commands produce different results:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
2*7 - 2*5 / 2

(2*7 - 2*5) / 2
```

__Note__ parentheses need to come in pairs: whenever you type an open parenthesis, (eventually you need to provide a corresponding closed parenthesis).

A very common way to get errors is by missing a parentheses. For instance, the following line of code will return a plus sign (+) since R is waiting for you to close the parenthetical before it processes your command:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
4 + (5
```

No matter how many parenthesis you have always close your parenthesis. Based on this which of the below is correct and why? 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
(((5+5)))

(((5+5))
```

So lesson is... always close your parentheses even for the funny ones like {...} and [...].

## Use built-in R functions {.unnumbered}

R has some built-in “functions” for common calculations. Rather than defining a function let's just do some.

Let's find the square-root of a number using the ‘squirt’ command, sqrt():

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
sqrt(16)
```

Note the use of parentheses here. When you are calling a function, when you see parentheses, think of the word ‘of’. This line translates to 'the square root of 16'. You are taking the sqrt of the number inside the parenthetical.

Let's try again with a different function. Find: the log of 4. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
log(4)
```

Note that the function `log()` is the natural log function (i.e., the value that e must be raised to in order to equal 4). To calculate a base-10 logarithm, use `log10( )`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
log(10)

log10(10)
```

Another handy function is round(), for rounding numbers to a specific number of decimal places.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
100/3

round(100/3)

round(100/3,digits=1)

round(100/3,digits=2)

round(100/3,digits=3)
```

Finally, R also comes with some built-in values, such as pi:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
pi
```

So now that you have used a few functions, let's define it. A function is a package of code that does the following:

* takes a given value, 
* transforms it according to some internal code instructions, 
* and provides an output. 

You will learn more about functions later, but this is a good intro.

## Objects and vectors {.unnumbered}

`R` can do so much more than be just a calculator. Your first step in uncovering the potential of `R` is to make variables.

### All things variables {.unnumbered}

To assign numbers or other types of data to a variable, you use the `<` and `-` characters to make the arrow symbol `<-`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
x <- 1
y <- 2
```

Where did those values go? You do not see the numbers printed in the _Console_ because the values were stored in the variables x, and y. These are now in the _Environment_. So how do we use or see these variables?

If you want R to tell you what x is, just type the variable name and run it.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
x
```

If you want to do calculations with the variables then do it.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
x + 100
x * 2
x + y
```

If you want to do calculations with variables and make that answer into a new variable, you can do that too. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
z <- x + y - 1
```

In `R`, a variable is another way to refer to value. That value can be as simple as a single number (e.g., 6) or as complex as a spreadsheet with thousands of rows and columns. Think of a variable as a cup; just as cups make it easy to hold your coffee and carry it from the kitchen to the couch, variables make it easy to contain and work with data.

Let's make a new variable from x that isn't just one value but is multiple values. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
a <- rep(x, 5)
```

How do you look at the response of `a` again? What does it look like the `rep()` function does?

Since `a` isn't just a single value, we can do some cool things, like find how many values are in the variable:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
length(a)
```

Let's create a vector, which is very similar to what we did above, and do some calculations:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
b <- c(1,2,3)
b + 100
b * 2
```

Good work! You're a master of this. So let's make it interesting. Let's look at some various ages. To start we need to make a new vector and give it a name, however

* A variable/vector name has to have at least one letter in it,
* A variable/vector name has to be connected. AKA no spaces. Instead of a space try a period  ( . ) or an underscore ( _ ). _Note: hyphens cannot be used_,

There are some other rules, but we can learn them as we go so let's jump in and create a variable with some ages and find out some information about these ages.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ages <- c(20, 30, 25, 35)
mean(ages)
max(ages)
min(ages)
median(ages)
summary(ages)
```

Now, in data it is super common to have NAs so let's make a vector called ages but introduce an NA and re-do all those functions. Does it work?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ages <- c(20, 30, 25, 35, NA, 28)
mean(ages)
```

It doesn't work! Well what if we try this:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ages <- c(20, 30, 25, 35, NA, 28)
mean(ages, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Did it work? Of course it did because you're a genius! But more importantly it actually worked because the `na.rm = TRUE` is removing the NA. We are saying "take the mean of ages and remove the NAs." What happens if we set na.rm to FALSE?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
mean(ages, na.rm = FALSE)
```

Why didn't this work? This is because we said "take the mean of ages and do not remove the NAs." We can't know the mean of ages when we are missing an age, so we need to remove the unknown in order to be able to do a calculation. Try the na.rm with the calculations we performed above.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
max(ages, na.rm = TRUE)
min(ages, na.rm = TRUE)
median(ages, na.rm = TRUE)
summary(ages, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Another interesting feature is that we can do comparisons like greater than and smaller than in R. Let's compare one age with many ages.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
old_threshold <- 30
ages > old_threshold
ages < old_threshold
table(ages > old_threshold)
```

This can be very useful right? Let's make an even larger vector and learn some tricks to do so. 

Sometimes it can be hard to type out each individual number hundreds of times so let's take a look below at what are some other ways to look at vectors.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
b <- 1:1000
d <- seq(0, 1000000, by = 10000)
length(d)
```

Up until this point we have focused on numbers which are numeric, but we can also work with words which we refer to as strings. Let's create a vector with some names of people and call it people and explore the names.

_Note: while you may want to name it names, R already has a function called names, and we want to avoid naming variables and vectors after functions. Just like we don't want to make a variable called mean or min._

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
people <- c('Michael', 'Nika', 'Delana')
people == 'Matthew'
people == 'Nika'
table(people == 'Nika')
'John' %in% people
'John' == people
```

## Exercises {.unnumbered}

**Use `R` like a calculator**  

**1.** Type a command in the *Console* to determine the sum of 596 and 198.  

**2.** Re-run the sum of 596 and 198 without re-typing it.  

**3.** Recall the command again, but this time adjust the code to find the sum of 596 and 298.  

**4.** Practice escaping an accidentally called command: recall your most recent command, then press the right key to clear the *Console*'s command line.  

&nbsp;  
**Recalling commands**  

**5.** Find the sum of the ages of everyone in your immediate family.  

**6.** Now recall that command and adjust it to determine the *average* age of the members of your family.  

**7.** Find the square root of *pi* and round the answer to the 2 decimal places.

&nbsp;    

**Finding errors**  

**8.** This line of code won't run; instead, `R` will wait for more with a `+` symbol. Find the problem and re-write the code so that it works.  

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,collapse=TRUE}
5 * 6 +
```

**9.** The same goes for this line of code. Fix it, too.  

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,collapse=TRUE}

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,collapse=TRUE}
round(100/3,digits+3)
```

**11.** Type a command of your own into R that throws an error, then recall the command and revise so that `R` can understand it.

**Show that the following statements are TRUE:**

**12.** `pi` is greater than the square root of 9  

**13.** It is FALSE that the square root of 9 is greater than `pi`  

**14.** `pi` rounded to the nearest whole number equals the square root of 9

## `R` and `RStudio`: what's the difference? {.unnumbered}

These two entities are similar, but it is important to understand how they are different. 

In short, `R` is an open-source (i.e., free) coding language: a powerful programming engine that can be used to do really cool things with data.

`R Studio`, in contrast, is a free _user interface_ that helps you interact with `R`. If you think of `R` as an engine, then it helps to think of `RStudio` as the car that makes it easier and more comfortable to use the engine to get where you want to go. 

`RStudio` needs `R` in order to function, but `R` can technically be used on its own outside of `RStudio` if you want. However, just as a good car mechanic can get an engine to run without being installed within a car, using `R` on its own is a bit clunky and requires some expertise. For beginners (and everyone else, really), `R` is just so much more pleasant to use when you are operating it from within `RStudio`.

`RStudio` als has increasingly powerful _features_ that make `R` even more useful and versatile in data science. For instance you can make an interactive data dashboard, beautifyl and reproducible data reports, presentations, websites, and even this book! And new features are regularly being added to `RStudio` by its all-star team of data scientists.

That's why we will _always_ use `RStudio´ when working with `R` in this book. 

## Two-minute tour of `RStudio` {.unnumbered}

When you open `RStudio`, you will see a window that looks like the screenshot below:

![](img/rstudio_windows.png)

### Console {.unnumbered}

You are already acquainted with RStudio’s Console, the window pane on the left that you use to “talk” to `R`.

### Environment {.unnumbered}

In the top right pane, the _Environment_, `RStudio` will maintain a list of all the datasets, variables, and functions that you are using as you work. The next modules will explain what variables and functions are.

### Files, Plots, Packages, & Help {.unnumbered}

You will use the bottom right pane very often.

* The **Files** tab lets you see all the files within your **working directory**, which will be explained in the section below.
* The **Plots** tab lets you see the plots you are producing with your code.
* The **Packages** tab lets you see the packages you currently have installed on your computer. Packages are bundles of R functions downloaded from the internet; they will be explained in detail a few modules down the road.
* The **Help** tab is very important! It lets you see documentation (i.e., user’s guides) for the functions you use in your code. Functions will also be explained in detail a few modules down the road.

These three panes are useful, but the most useful window pane of all is actually _missing_ when you first open RStudio. This important pane is where you work with **scripts**.
