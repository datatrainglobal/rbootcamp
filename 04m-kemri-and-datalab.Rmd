# KEMRI & DataLab Summer Workbook

## Day 1 {.unnumbered}

This summer you all are going to work as a team and learn to code and also get to know one another. So what is a better way to get to know someone than by learning about their hometown. Today, in your groups you are going to put pins on a map that represent every person's hometown from your group. 

Follow along this document as a team to make this map:

### Make your dataset {.unnumbered}

**1.** Make one google sheet and title it: `team_lat_lng` with columns `first_name`, `lat`, `lng`. *Note: make sure these columns are in this exact order and spelled exactly the same.*

**2.** Click 'Share' in the top right of the google sheet and in 'General access' click 'Anyone with the link'. *Note: this is important because in order to read data into R, it must be available to be accessed by everyone.*

**3.** Input everyone's name and hometown latitude and longitude in the associated columns. To find your latitude and longitude, go to Google Maps and right click your hometown and input the latitude (first number) and longitude (second number) from google maps into your google sheet. Here is an example of Sewanee's latitude and longitude:

There? Woohoo! You have your dataset!

### Load in your data {.unnumbered}

**4.** For the KEMRI team, make a folder called `name_datalab` on your desktop (make sure to put your name where I wrote name). Everyone, in your `name_datalab` folder make another folder called `team_map`.

**5.** Everyone open up `RStudio` and make an `RScript` and name it `our_map.R` and save it into your `team_map` folder.

**6.** Starting now, make sure you comment every line of your script. So make a comment that says `# set working directory` and set your working directory to your `team_map` folder.

**7.** Load the following libraries (if you don't have them make sure to install them with `install.packages()`: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthhires)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
library(tmap)
library(osmdata)
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(spData)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gsheet)
```

**8.** Now, there are two ways to load in your data:

  a. Download the google sheet as a csv file and and save it into your `team_map` folder. Then in your RScript load in the data and assign it to an object: `locations <- read_csv('team_lat_lng.csv')`. In your environment do you have locations? If so, great!
  
  b. Another simpler way to download the data is by using the following: `locations <- gsheet::gsheet2tbl('insert link')`. Still have locations after this? Wonderful!
  
### Make your map {.unnumbered}

**9.** 

### Share your work

Congratulations you did it! Save your image, share it in slack, and make sure everyone on your team has an RScript that works. Once you've done this you're all set. Have a great day or night wherever you are in the world!
