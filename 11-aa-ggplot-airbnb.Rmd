# AirBnB & `ggplot`  

This review exercise is useful immediately after you learn `ggplot2` 

&nbsp;  

First, let's start a new script and load up some useful libraries.

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(ggthemes)
```

Then, download a csv from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vAdkM-UOliPeDAMqZ-6VHbvN_KZyQve9/view?usp=sharing) and put it in your working directory.

Finally, read in the downloaded csv and name the dataframe `air`.

**1.** How many rows are in the dataset?

**2.** How many columns are in the dataset?

**3.** What are the names of the columns?

**4.** Map the coordinates using ggplot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = air) +
  geom_point(aes(x = longitude,
                 y = latitude))
```

**5.** Make lots of interesting plots.
